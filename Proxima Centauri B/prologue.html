<p>We didn't invent the time machine — it availed itself to us of nature’s bounty, its wandering path through the cosmos bringing it toward the solar system like a friendly neighbor offering sugar. It was detected first by the New Horizons probe, then our most distant (working) ambassador to the stars… albeit indirectly. The probe’s sensors, tuned to optical measurements, saw nothing of note. But the network back home, triangulating its ephemeris, pinging its location, began to register a deviation from its nominal trajectory. At first, it was minuscule, one part in a million. Then it wasn’t.</p>

<p>It occurred to us quickly, then, that something out there was tugging our little probe off course. We thought, briefly, that it might be an undiscovered gas giant, orbiting in the backest of backwaters of our solar system.<sup id="fnref:1" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote" rel="footnote">1</a></sup> But it only took three data points, gathered along the new trajectory, each taken a day apart, to calculate the mass and location of the interloper.</p>

<p>When it was determined to have a mass of one hundred and twenty suns, our guest's identity became clear: a black hole, invisible to any electromagnetic light, yet beginning to exert its slight gravity over the outer solar system.</p>

<p>Now knowing where to look, we quickly found it, noting the spiking magnification of background stars bending around it towards us as it lurked in the depths of space.</p>

<p>Many, when the news broke, thought it signaled the end of times foretold —Armageddon! — despite scientists’ best efforts to reassure the public that its arcing path through the galaxy would take it safely past our system, well beyond the orbit of Pluto, and fast enough that there should be no major effect on the orbit of the planets.<sup id="fnref:2" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:2" class="footnote" rel="footnote">2</a></sup></p>

<p>Other scientists, less concerned with public reassurance, had instead been running the numbers. The numbers tended to be cold, discrete. But in this case, they represented a dream that had festered in the minds of humanity since before Einstein even theorized <em>it</em> was actually possible.</p>

<p>It had been named ISO-6563, as it was the 6,563rd interstellar object to visit our corner of the universe. (Most of the prior guests were comets.) It, as was calculated, would swing by our solar system with a periapse occurring in roughly six years after its initial discovery. It would pass roughly perpendicular to the plane of the solar system; that is, traveling in tandem with the velocity of the sun, from a galactic frame of reference, albeit a good 100 km/s faster than the sun made its languid orbit about the galactic center. Scientists theorized that given its mass, it was likely the result of a collision — <em>coalescence</em> — of two less massive black holes, a process which appeared to have imparted a strong velocity kick on the resultant black hole.</p>

<p>The <em>Nostradamus</em> set off from earth on the heaviest rockets it could muster.<sup id="fnref:3" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:3" class="footnote" rel="footnote">3</a></sup> It reached Jupiter in six months, then dipped deep into its gravity well to slingshot itself out toward the empty, vast space beyond the orbit of Pluto, burning a bit of fuel at its deepest descent to sling out at roughly twice the speed with which it entered.<sup id="fnref:4" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:4" class="footnote" rel="footnote">4</a></sup></p>

<p>It tacked not toward the black hole, but rather to the location where it would closest pass the sun, three years hence (for this effort took three years of breakneck pace work and budgets abandoned to posterity).</p>

<p><em>Nostradamus</em> could never hope to match the speed of the thing, which was tearing past with far greater velocity than anything in the solar system was moving. But they didn’t need to catch up, not entirely.</p>

<p>They were probably going to die. That much was abundantly clear when they set out. It was moderately unclear whether the vessel would even handle the accelerations and tidal forces it would be put throught. It was entirely unclear whether the crew, in hastily-developed suspension chambers, surrounded by jelly, their own blood intentionally thickened, would survive those same forces. Fifteen more years, and the tech would’ve been there, so the engineers lamented.<sup id="fnref:5" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:5" class="footnote" rel="footnote">5</a></sup></p>

<p>But ISO-6534 was passing now. They’d get only one chance.</p>

<p>You see, this is the <em>thing</em> about spaceflight. For all the myriad, dangerous, but surmountable obstacles — the micrometeorites, the radiation damage to ship and cell, the muscle atrophy due to zero-gravity, life support, the list goes on — one single <em>adamant</em> wall stands tall before humanity's explorative flood into the cosmos.</p>

<p>Things are far apart.</p>

<p><em>Correction:</em> Things are far apart, even at the speed of light, but we, in the throes of our earliest spacefaring development, have no fuel source that can even <em>hope</em> to accelerate long enough without running out to bring any scientific ship of reasonable mass to anything <em>approaching</em> the speed of light.</p>

<p>Our nearest stellar neighbor, Alpha Centauri, shuffles through the galaxy a mere 4.37 light years away. And behold, it even has rocky planets!</p>

<p>Our most powerful rockets could produce ∆-v's of ~1.3 km/s. It would take a million years (literally; 1 Myr) to get to Alpha Centauri that way.</p>

<p>No energy source known could produce the acceleration needed to make the trip to our next nearest star possible. We lack the ability to accelerate to even 0.1<em>c</em>. As does ISO-6563. We have no trick up our sleeve to slingshot around this black hole,<sup id="fnref:7" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:7" class="footnote" rel="footnote">6</a></sup> and it itself will take four hundred years to reach its periapse with that system.<sup id="fnref:8" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:8" class="footnote" rel="footnote">7</a></sup></p>

<p>When the crew of the <em>Nostradamus</em> hitch a ride in orbit of ISO-6563, they will under a gradual acceleration toward the ISCO<sup id="fnref:9" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:9" class="footnote" rel="footnote">8</a></sup> reach velocities of up to 0.95<em>c</em>. This is unhelpful for interstellar travel insofar as climbing back <em>out</em> of the potential well would rob them of almost all of it.</p>

<p>But what ISO-6563 is, in all its glorious general relativistic beauty, is a time machine. Orbiting at 0.95<em>c</em> deep in the well of the black hole, the four hundred-year trip to Alpha Centauri will come out to only ~47 years from the perspective of the humans on board.<sup id="fnref:10" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:10" class="footnote" rel="footnote">9</a></sup> A long time, but survivable.</p>

<p>If it is difficult to understand the international outpouring of funding to make <em>Nostradamus</em> happen, I do not blame you. Science is very often waylaid by, or co-opted for, more prudent<sup id="fnref:11" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:11" class="footnote" rel="footnote">10</a></sup> matters. But the worldwide astronomical community availed the world on the fact that this was not a once in a lifetime opportunity. It was a once in a civilization opportunity. It was entirely possible that we would <em>never</em> in the evolution of our society develop technology that could reliably move a human to another star system. ISO-6563 was our only ticket out.</p>

<p>I wish I could tell you that they made it. But I am dying now, and their journey will continue on for many decades still.<sup id="fnref:12" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:12" class="footnote" rel="footnote">11</a></sup></p>
