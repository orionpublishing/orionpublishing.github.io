# Chapter 1
## Jannis 

Jannis walked into the *Captain's Quarters Cantina* to the sound of cheers. The place was a dump, as always, but it had been wholly commandeered by flare pilots and flare pilots in training. 

Any pilot who survived their race would be welcomed with a cheer in this place. Jannis usually got a standing ovation. 

Glancing around the room, he saw several veterans of the flare races sitting at tables and seeming to enjoy the fetid swill the Cantina served. 

It was odd. But he knew most volunteers for the races were either destitute, recently-liberated slaves, indentured with life debts, or those being blackmailed into it. If you survived... well, the credits were nice, but you didn't become an aristocrat overnight. Nor did you lose your taste for dive swill, so it seemed. 

Jannis wound his way through the room, politely dodging claps to the shoulder and calls for him to sit down. He arrived finally at a small table in the rear of the joint, one held up by seal-tape and, probably, spit. 

"Ayy, the god-touched returns!" came the jovial welcome from Edaar Velaguates --- flare veteran, now instructor. "*Por favor dime que compraste una buena chica*..." 

Jannis sat down with a grunt, pulling off his cloth cap to let his shaggy hair hang down around his face. Edaar maintained a fiesty table, but he was an actual veteran, unlike most in the bar, and somehow his ribbing rang less remora-ish than others. At minimum, he'd never slammed Jannis into a wall and demanded he reveal his *secret*.

"The answer's the same every time Edaar," Jannis replied, "If I had any interest in life's finer things, I wouldn't be at the Quarters with you." 

Edaar laughed uproariously, despite having heard the line a dozen times. 

"Fine *hombre*," he said, as his wheezing died down. "Meet my new friends. And by that I mean *your* new friends." 

Jannis nodded begrudgingly at the assembled crew at the table, who looked no older than sixteen or seventeen by the way they couldn't fill out their flight suits or the patchiness of their thin mustaches. 

Edaar leaned in conspiratorially. 

"These boys are looking to enter the races. They reckon you’re a good luck charm, even though I tell them you are just *el tonto*. You’re certainly the luckiest motherfucker in the galaxy, eh? Juare here said earlier he'd kill for a lock of your hair. Any interest in selling?"

Jannis couldn't help but smile as the boys at the table all lit up bright red, one in particular folding into themselves in embarrassment.

"Hmm," he said, leaning toward the closest boy to his right. "What do *you* think it's worth?" he asked, reaching up and holding out a small chunk of his locks towards the boy's face. 

The boy began to stammer incoherently, and Jannis let his hair fall and patted him on the shoulder. 

"I can assure you my hair is worth either *nothing*, or so much you couldn't afford it until *after* your first run," Jannis said. "So no use thinking about it." 

Ignoring Edaar's laugh from his left, he looked across at one of the boys on the far side of the table. 

"Aren't you a little young for racing?" he asked, though it wasn't really a question. The boy looked barely fourteen. 

"Aye, sir," the boy responded, "I'm just training now. I've never piloted, see. But I need to race as soon as I'm allowed." 

Jannis had the good sense not to prod. The answer was always depressing. Probably a sister or family in chains. 

He didn't *approve* of Edaar's post-race choice to run a flight school training the next generation of sacrifices... but he had to admit that he'd rather Edaar be teaching them than anyone else. He was just about the best damned pilot Jannis had ever seen in action. And his kids had a habit of surviving a few percentage points more of the time than anyone else.

"So what was it this time," Edaar asked, breaking his brief reverie. "*Fourteen* runs? Surely not." 

Jannis rolled his eyes. There was no way to answer this question without earning fawning looks or gasps. He simply shrugged. 

"I stopped counting," he said. 

"Ahh, spoken like a true *tarado*," Edaar responded, gesticulating at him while looking at his students. "You listen here, my best lesson I can give you is to *not be like Jannis*," he concluded. "You live past your race, you go give your *madre* a kiss and you never fly a space ship again, you hear me?" 

Jannis looked away. He hoped they would follow that advice, or better yet, never race, but he knew if he looked he'd see their determination to do the opposite. It was like that with every crop.

"I have to go," he said. "Auction is starting soon." 

"Ayyyyy, brother," Edaar moaned, drawing out the sound. "You haven't even had a drink yet. Why you never just watch it here with everyone else?"

Jannis reached out and swiped Edaar's drink, downing it in one painful pull. 

"There, now I've had a drink," he said, forcing down a burp. "I'll watch it here as soon as you prove to me I can focus without you screeching in my ear and distracting me." 

He stood, cuffed the now-pudgy man playfully across the ear, eliciting a mock cry, nodded at the young pilots-in-training, and left the bar.

-----

Farudan Station orbited the planet bearing its name, tucked into a quiet, neutral system that sat at the end of a spoke of the Second Galactic Empire in a region considered neutral bordering the Concordia Matczesum.

By all rights, it would be a forgettable system, if not for the auctions. Given the SGE's rather tempestuous relations with its other neighbors, the merchant guild of the Concordia found the right theirs to host the Eneregium auctions, from which they profited by fraction and by prestige. 

Still, it was a rather dinky station. The auction itself happened planetside, in the gilded halls of the Matczesum houses, with the majority of atendees delegates from around the galaxy. Travel to and from planetary surfaces was still rather expensive --- weaving hadn't solved *that* problem yet. The gravity problem. Many spacers spent their whole lives off planet, knowing systems by their stations alone.

Jannis walked along the outer corridor of the rotating ring of the station, seeking a quiet place to hide himself. Below him, the floor of hardened clear nanoplastics showed the planetary surface below. He'd heard Farudan had once been green and lush, but that simply meant it had been survivable. The weavers of the SGE had since shaped the planet to their will, glittering cities shining like stars on the planet's surface, structures extending so high into the atmosphere they were visible from the station above. 

A quiet corner presented itself in an unused hangar bay. He settled down, pulling his cap back over his head, and waited to see what he'd earned.

-----

Jannis stood as the auction began, leaning against a railing looking down over a drydock. Sliding his finger upward along his comm, he sent the live view of the auction boards whooshing up into a holographic frame in front of him. He watched carefully as the numbers ticked by. It had been a good run. He'd brought full cores, and it appeared several others had bugged out after fifty or sixty percent, but still supplied a decent amount. 

He knew they'd be gazing at him with hostility if they were anywhere in the room. Their contracts were designed such that screaming out early led to a massive slash to a racer's portion of the sale. The lenders were, after all, supplying them with ships and equipment for each run. No full tank, no full cut. 

He'd stayed till the end, as he always had. And had lived, yet again. He knew rumors already abounded about him. *Good luck charm* was the most benign. Some thought he was an agent of the SGE, with some unheard of means of communicating while on a run. Others thought he was a weaver who could somehow weave while in the overwhelming field inside the exclusion zone. Whatever the theory, it painted him a cheater. He'd faced more than one corridor stabbing attempt on Farudan Station. 

His comm dinged, notifying him that his cores were up. His eyes scanned the holoscreen, tracking the bids coming in. He was a little surprised SGE hadn't surreptitiously pilfered his full cores before the auction. They often did, though it didn't matter to him; he still got paid a fair price. 

He gave a quick mental thanks to whichever god or physics equation determined that Eneregium couldn't be transferred between containers --- once siphoned from a source, it could only be *used*. His full cores were worth significantly more than the partial ones.

Calculating a quick regression on the bids, he figured he would be earning a veritable fortune on this run. That happened sometimes; whenever a few previous runs had gone poorly and supply was short, or when the galactic credit was in flux. The currency was actually tied to the auction price of Eneregium, though Jannis never claimed to understand how that worked. 

As the bell rang on the auction, he tightened his mouth, though whether to a smile or grimace was unclear. He closed the holoscreen, now using the holo-tab itself for more privacy. 

As he waited for the credit transfer, he looked again out over the twinkling lights of the rotating station and the glittering planet below. *All these pilots, dying, risking death, just so* they *can weave a monument to their ego across every system in the galaxy.*

Jannis felt a buzz, and confirmed the amount transferred into his account represented his negotiated cut. Then he tapped a few selections into his comm, and watched as the units drained out of his accounts in a flicker of ones and zeros. 

He put his comm in his pocket, and walked back through the station toward his cabin.
