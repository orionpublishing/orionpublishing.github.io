# Prologue

Jannis Tarkadin sat in a coffin at the center of the galaxy, counting down the seconds until his death. Just behind his ship, past thick layers of radiation shielding, swirled the accretion disk that fed *Gargantuan*, the galaxy’s super massive black hole. 

Technically the edge of the disk was a nearly-incomprehensible distance away in human terms; the intervening space was larger than most star systems. But that detail wouldn’t stop the waves of γ-radiation from frying him instantly were it not for the shielding. And it certainly wouldn’t stop a *flare* from frying him *and* his ship, shielding or no. 

Officially, Jannis was floating at *Mark V*, a location 15 percent inward of the outer edge of the Galactic Exclusion Zone — so defined because within it, a standard ship could not protect its inhabitants from the radiation field.

Unofficially --- as he glanced at the readouts on the panel before him --- he saw he had drifted inward several hundred additional stellar units. That was fine. A flare would kill him anyway, and being closer in would boost his siphon. 

As if on cue, Jannis heard a beep and glanced over at his siphon readings. His tanks were at nearly 60 percent, meaning he had to hold on for roughly ten more minutes before he could disengage, sending his screamer --- the small, barely armored, scrapped-together-but-nonetheless-*exceedingly*-fast ship in which he was currently crammed --- out of the bottom of the heavily armored junker, leaving it behind as he blasted himself and his precious cargo out of the exclusion zone. 

Both the junker, and the screamer tucked in its belly, had no named designations --- they were designed to be single use. Inhabitants of the galaxy were not typically in the habit of constructing single-use space ships, but these represented a tiny fraction of what he’d earn if he got his cargo safely out of the zone and into the waiting hands of the Second Galactic Empire. Or the highest bidder. The two were usually the same.

A different beeping, two overlapping, discordant tones,  one slightly more frantic in tenor, began pulsing from a different screen. His accretion disk monitors. One he silenced with a tap; it was warning about a steady increase in radiation above safety limits, which he was expecting, given his inward drift. The other was more concerning. 

Whenever a particularly large, viscous clump of superheated matter within the otherwise fairly smooth accretion disk finally fell into *Gargantuan*, it produced a massive burst of energy. A flare. A flare meant death for anyone in, or near, the GEZ. 

Star systems close to the galactic center could monitor the disk for potential flares using large, highly complex telescopes... but electromagnetic signals could not pierce the wash of electromagnetic energy in the zone, so Jannis was on his own. He had only several basic sensors that could roughly indicate a possible incoming flare. He also had one that could detect the leading wave of a flare, but he’d already disabled that one. If it triggered, he was already dead. 

He looked back to the siphon screens, which tracked how much Eneregium he had gathered. 73 percent. Enough to buy most spacers out of a life debt.  Enough to buy a small moon, in the right part of the galaxy.

Still he held on, eyes darting to the flare sensors. The Oracle he’d seen had predicted this should be a clean run --- no flares --- but if he had to count on two hands, it would be easier count the number of pilots given an accurate prediction from the oracles than those who hadn’t. Put another way, the survival rate per run for pilots who took part in the flare races was around 17 percent. That was why nearly every pilot who'd survived their race had never gone back in. Except Jannis.

Sweat began to pool on Jannis’s face. His ship had no atificial gravity, so it didn’t drip into his eyes, but he wiped it away nonetheless. 84 percent. 

The junker gave a pained shudder, sensors complaining about differential forces on the ship body exceeding limits. Grinding his teeth in frustration, he fired up the junker's thrusters and pushed himself back out toward the nominal *Mark V* position. 

*Damn hole,* he thought, *has to fuck me up with both radiation* and *gravity.*

The siphon’s rate noticeably decreased as he flew, and he cursed again. Something was coming. He could feel it in his bones. The adrenaline had started to build, the edge of death sidling up next to him in the cramped cockpit, his finger hovering over the button that would bail him out of this hellhole. But not yet. 

The interior of the screamer was only large enough barely to fit Jannis, his body extended in a standing --- or laying, since there was no preferred direction --- orientation. Just below his feet, his siphon tanks, each also roughly the size of a human, were stacked to the back of the ship. The front of the ship was above his head, but to save him straining his neck, the console of small screens were mounted in front of his face, while a small set of manual controls --- a joystick and accelerator ---  extended from under the console at arm level.

He reached underneath the console and pulled out a small holo-tablet. Its screen was almost completely frazzled by the overlapping matrix lines, but the reading he was seeking was there, buried in the noise. Just a little bit longer and he'd have it. He locked the device and stowed it. 

The frantic beeping of the flare monitor turned into a steady whine. *Flare imminent.* Jannis growled. 94 percent. It was time to improvise. 

The screamer had no windows --- or rather, its cockpit screens revealed only the dark interior of the Junker's hangar bay. There was no point in trying to mount cameras outside the junker; they would simply fry, or return an alien image dominated by streaking bands caused by cosmic rays and high energy particles slashing across the detector.

He knew that most pilots would've bailed and screamed out by now. Flares were somewhat directional, but a racer's sensors were nowhere near accurate enough to predict their trajectories. When the sensor flatlined, you bailed. 

Only Jannis didn't bail. He reached out and fumbled for the switch that silenced the alarm, cutting it off like a spacer ejected from an airlock. He reached out and grabbed the joystick, flipping up the safety and jamming his thumb into the switch for manual control. 

The ship shuddered around him as the autoguiding thrusters disengaged. He felt a flutter in the pit of his stomach as the ship began accelerating back inward toward *Garganutan*, having been left idly in its gravitational field. 

He flared the accelerator and pulled back on the joystick, sending the junker into a wide turn, then flashed the thrusters. He still had fuel left --- most pilots, by training, burned straight to *Mark V* using their junker's full reserves, to maximize time siphoning. Jannis had instead drifted in on coast, saving fuel. One of many small tricks one could only learn by being stupid enough to try this game more than once. 

Burning hard, his junker rattled its way around *Gargantuan*. Flares being pseudo directional as they were, a flatline sensor in one location meant that another might be safer. He had no possible way to pick a direction; he chose randomly, letting instinct guide him. 

96 percent. By staying in the exclusion zone, he could still siphon, but his increased velocity decreased the rate. *Still, better to be alive,* he thought. 

His console screen buzzed, informing him the Junker was now out of fuel. He had a significant transverse velocity now, but not enough to maintain a circular orbit at this distance from Gargantuan. As he moved, his orbital radius would drift inward toward the supermassive black hole. 

*All part of the plan,* he thought. *The crazy, stupid plan, but still.* Flares from the accretion disk tended to fan out, filling larger areas of space as they went. So ironically, spiralling closer in meant a better chance of avoiding its tendril. 

The computerized voice called out. 

``*Mark VI*, mark,'' indicating he had already drifted in another five percent. Jannis knew he'd now entered the region in which stray particle and radiation pressure was actually strong enough to buffet the ship. He could hear micrometeorite impacts pinging against the outer hull of the junker. At this distance, millions of high energy particles per second, which slipped through his now-inadequate shielding, were passing through his body. Many would pass straight through, their cross section of interaction far smaller then his body's cells. But some tiny fraction would be perfectly aligned to strike the structure of his DNA, damaging a few cells. Damage which could easily bring about a cancer. Through the shaking, he read off the siphon. 98 percent. 

He itched to check his holo-tab, but had no time. He had to assume that forcing the closer orbit would help. 

Instead, he prepped himself for scream-out. He had no fuel to boost to a larger orbit, so he'd be screaming out from far deeper in the well than most. He tugged the joystick, activating the lateral thrusters and rotating the junker to be once again oriented radially with *Gargantuan*. Then he pulled off the safety cover of the singular physical switch on his screen-based console. *EJECT.*

Fingers twitching above it, he watched the siphon. 99 percent. He had no idea if he'd escaped the flare's trajectory. Against his better judgement, he flipped back on the sensor. It whined for a moment, flatlining, before reverting to a frantic beep. 

*Okay,* he thought. *Better than before, at least.*

Suddenly, klaxons fired off around the cramped cabin. The several at play confused him for a split second, before realizing he'd flipped back on the actual flare detectors, which had mixed with the alarm of the siphons reaching 100 percent. 

*Time to go,* he thought, before slamming a hand down on the eject button. 

-----

Nothing happened. 

-----

He pressed it again, waiting for the characteristic clunk of the hangar bays opening, followed by the jerk of the hanger arms thrusting the screamer out into the void, followed by the immediate $g$-force of thrust pushing him back as the screamer burned hot and dirty for the exits. None of it came. 

*Bik'r*, he cursed violently, feeling death constricting at his chest, blurring his vision. Breathing through his panic, he reached under the screen console to where the computer system's core mounted into the ship controls. He clutched at it and, finding purchase, ripped it out. 

Immediately, all of his console screens went dark, and the cockpit dropped into near-total darkness, the only dim light being cast by the emergency strips.  

Grasping within the bramble of shorn wires and sparking electricity left behind where the module had een, his fingers searched for the life saving, cool metal touch of the manual escape handle. 

*Where is it?* 

He desperately rooted around, the abject fear that his lender for this run had cut one too many corners on the ship construction and a manual handle hadn't been added. Streaks began to dance across his vision like fireworks --- particles that were now piercing both hulls, and, he knew, his body. A sort of anti-tunnel vision took him, the edges of his vision lit up while the center of his vision darkened. 

But as he wrung his hand through the narrow space for what felt like the hundreth time, his fingers wrapped around the cool metal of the handle, and he yanked it with what was left of his sanity, and he heard the lifeblood of clanks and bangs as the screamer was ejected into space and streamed forward into the night.
