Khalid knelt, and started whispering, before she interrupted. 

"No, this feels wrong." Saira gestured, and he stood gingerly. She patted the cot next to her and he sat, and she gently guided his head down to lay in her lap. She slid her fingers through his hair, tugging lightly at the tangles. 

"There," she said. "When you were cold, and hungry, or sick with fever, when we huddled in alleys and doorstops. Here we held each other and there was nothing else in the world. Here is where we were each other’s religion."
 	
 He turned his head to face her, curling his still-scrawny form around her waist, as she continued to stroke his hair. He began once again to chant, at first an inaudible whisper but soon words began to tumble from his lips, ancient words, unrecognizable words. Pulses of light escaped his mouth, sinking into her abdomen as she tried not to panic, tried to keep her breathing calm. Heat, like warming fire and a strong spirit, spread through her, jagged like lightning beneath her skin. And then all went white — not unconsciousness, but a conscience Saira has no capacity nor capability to comprehend. 


Khalid woke with a headache, as he often did after a large working. He sat up, rubbing his temple, trying to sort out what the working took from him, and what it left behind. 

Then he saw Saira.

"What the fuck?"

"Yeah," she replied. She was sitting cross legged on the floor in the middle of their tent, examining the wings that stretched out from her back in either direction, easily 15 feet, curling and twisting at her command. Their iridescent glow seemed to shift between gold and white, their texture sliding hypontizingly between organic feather and metallic daggers.

"I… what?"

"Your guess is as good as mine," she said. "I don’t think they’re.. quite real. See,"
And she pulled them in, tucking them behind her back. As she stood, he saw that the wingtips barely reached the backs of her knees, forming a sleek profile that seemed impossible given their span. 

"It… it must be a neuromantic effect. But how? You can't work organic matter… and *you* would have to be spending bucketloads of memory to power it."

"And I don’t have any handy memories of having wings," she pointed out. 

"Right…"

"At least I can punch you from across the room now," she said, whipping one wing out and jabbing him with the wingtip. After the second, he batted it aside, marveling at the texture.

"I remember something..." Khalid fought against the blur of what was left behind. "I think a drawing, on the page. Some winged creature. It wasn’t part of the blueprint so I didn’t really note it."

She jabbed him again. "Could’ve told me that, dingbat."

Khalid shrugged. "You don't seem terribly hung up about it. Do they ah, work?"

Saira rolled her eyes. "I decided it would not be most wise to jump off a rooftop and die while you were unconscious, nor to be seen cartwheeling above Aeurtuhm wielding obvious neuromantic abilities right where a priest might see me."

"This is why you're the brains of our operation," Khalid said, conceding the point well earned.

"You know," she said with a twinkle in her eye, 'You’ll have to worship me forever now. To keep this going."

He scoffed. "I may not remember exactly but I definitely did *not* say that was part of the blueprint." He could feel his face heating, and decided to examine a knotted end of the cot that was fraying out.

She shrugged demurely, and he felt his stomach tumble at the way the movement of her shoulders caused the iridescent wings to flutter in the corner of his eye. 

"You said I should be able to use neuromancy, now. Will you teach me?"

"I’m not sure anything I know will be even remotely applicable," Khalid said.

"Well, we should start there anyway," Saira responded.

It was at this point that four men, armed with scimitars, burst through their tent walls.
