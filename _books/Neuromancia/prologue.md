# Prologue


Khalid stood at the threshold of the chamber in the heart of the temple, vibrating with nerves. But he hadn't given four years of his life to this con only to piss out now. 

He stepped across and into the Valley of the Priests. The chamber was long as a city street, its sharply rising, outward-banking walls seating the hundreds of priests that made up the Cognozi. They each wore their robes up, hanging partially over their faces, each with an identical mask of pure white. 

Khalid did not climb the grueling staircases to join the ranks of seated figures. He, and the other initiates who had filed in before him, were snaking straight down the valleys rough-hewn floor. Toward the altar. 

There were fifty of them in all. More than two hundred had entered his class of initiates. Most were of families of middling wealth --- ones who could send their children to the schools but not afford to sustain them forever. The priesthood offered the promise of a stable, enviable salary. The rich never joined the Cognozi. 

Khalid did not come from one of those families, though he tried his best to conceal that from his fellow initiates. As the cullings had sent wave after wave home in shame and rejection, it became harder to hide that his knowledge was recently --- and rapidly --- acquired. It didn't much matter, because the more he interacted, the higher chance someone would grow suspicious. Best to keep to himself. 

In neat rows of five, the initiates knelt before the altar at the end of the valley. Before them, seated thirty feet above the altar, sat the High Priests Cognozum. They sat straight backed, larger than life. Tight vestments hinted at bulging muscles rippling beneath. Each had a mask of pure gold, features carved into perfection. Unlike the Cognozi, theirs did not have eye, nose, or mouth holes. 

Khalid eyed them wearily. Like many of the other initiates, his mind swam with the four years of grueling study he had completed --- memorization of complex, intricate workings and designs, long tomes of poetry and descriptions of battles long ago fought. 

For every other initiate kneeling around him, Khalid wagered this would be the crowning moment of their lives, the first in a long line of moments serving the priesthood. He did not plan to stick around. But he had to make it through the initiation. Had to make it through tonight. 

None of them knew what it entailed. Rumors abounded, growing stronger and more terrifying within the ranks of the final year initiates. *Perhaps they shall tell us what it is we are to be priests of*, Khalid thought. 

He quelled his thoughts as the High Priests stood, balancing their bare feet on thin ledges that supported only their heels. The Five stood regally in silence as their central member raised an arm. 

"Today we will share with you the great secret of our empire, that you might join in its survival, its growth, and its legacy. You know that our empire is forged and our world shaped by the power to mold reality to our will. You know that this power expends memory to do so. That a man, once burned all their memories away, becomes a monstrous, animalistic thing. 

"You have seen us, the Cognozum, work great wonders. And you, and all in this land, may wonder how we achieve such heights without destroying ourselves. Our enemies, and those domestic terrorists who seek to use such powers against our great empire, to tear it apart at the seams, they *especially* wish to know how, no matter how powerful they grow, we always crush them back down. 

"We will tell you this secret, granted to us by the Radiant Host above themselves. The secret to all great neuromantic workings. 

"The secret is you."

*Shit. What the fuck does* that *mean?*

"We are as one the mind of empire," the high priest continued. "We are as one the fist of justice, we are as one the builder of nations." The assembled priests in the stands murmured, their chant echoing across the valley, repeating the high priest's words.

"All that is the empire sits within this hallowed Valley. To protect the peace, the prosperity, and the survival of this land, requires sacrifice."

*Shit, shit, shitting shit.*

"We the high priests are but humble servants to our people. We strike down our enemies with the weight of an army. You will soon join the ranks of that army."

Khalid resisted the urge to glance around at the priests sitting in the walls. How much of them was left?

"We ask of you to give yourself to the cause of this place. To give of your dreams and memories to ensure our land stays free. It is a great sacrifice, we know. But all present here have made it." 

"We are one," chanted the priests in unison, the low rumble of their voices impacting the core of Khalid's sternum.

"We will care for you. You will live a long life. A good life. A life with meaning, purpose. A life with your needs met. We will not use more than is needed." 

*Sure, right.*

"And so shall you step forth to the altar, and forge a neuromantic link with one of us," he gestured around him to the other four high priests. "Henceforth we shall be joined. We do not force this upon you. Any unwilling to give this gift may leave in peace."

*Fucking sure,* Khalid thought, *if it's the peace of floating face down in the Daanar river. But how do I get out of this?* His plans were collapsing around him. 

One by one, the initiates stepped up to the altar and laid their foreheads upon the stone. In time, each high priest floated down, claiming ten of the fifty initiates each. Laying a hand upon their down-turned heads. 

"To forge the bond, you must release a memory willingly," the high priest boomed. "A strong memory. Think to your childhood, to the moment you first saw your mother. Think to her embrace." 

Khalid shivered. This was some absolutely fucked up shit. And it looked like he'd have to do it. 

Some initiates squirmed and writhed under the forming bond. Some screamed. A few passed out, and were gently dragged away by attending priests. And then it was Khalid's turn. 

Trying not to shake visibly, he stood and made his way to the altar, frantically flicking through memories he was willing to give up, yet knowing none would be sufficient. 

His forehead touched cool stone, yet it felt like burning lava, icy hot, humming with power. It's surface was wet, slightly, from the tears of previous initiates. He could almost extend his mind out to grasp the power, and then the high priest was there. 

The hand lay on his head, but he could barely feel it under the crushing weight of the high priest's will. It seemed to squeeze his mind, his whole existence, into the tiniest of motes. 

He felt a voice, silky, insistent, growling. *Give.*

He panicked, and in his panic he saw his father. Saw the man pick up the plate of fine tile and smash it across his mother's face, saw her collapse to the ground. The blood seeping on tile. His screams. His promises, to kill that vermin of a man. 

And then he was gone. 

Khalid blinked, his head rising from the stone. He couldn't tell if he'd been screaming... his throat felt hoarse and constricted. Tears specked the edges of his eyes. He frantically thought back, to his childhood. 

*What have I given??* 

As he stood in a daze, following the path the other initiates had taken out of the side of the Valley, he tried desperately to channel his thoughts, step through his memories methodically. Until he reached mother. Where was his mother? A small part within him whispered that she was dead. He knew this. But then who...

His father. He seized upon the words, cradling them to him like a precious gift. Tears now fell freely. His father. Khalid had given him up. He pushed, willing his mind to remember the man. But only inky blankness remained. He blinked again. His memories of his father were gone but... he couldn't remember why. 

That night, he escaped the temple.
