# Dragonseye 

Ven stood on the forward deck of the *Sunrise* as thick, white cloud swirled around her. Over the front edge was nothing but thick fog; glancing behind her, she could make out only the first thirty or so feet of the ship itself before it slipped into the mists. To her left, Jaresh stood tall, vibrating with excitement, peering forward into the clouds. The air was still and silent, save for the light, constant swish of the *Sunrise*'s air-elemental ring behind them. 

Next to Jaresh, leaning casually with her back against the railing, was Vys. The sight of her here still startled Ven. 

*What did Jaresh know that was so valuable to the Matron of Whispers,* she thought with a shudder. *And what does* she *know that will get us out of this battle alive?*

Vys's roving eyes fell upon Ven, and she winked playfully. Ven tried to smile back, but couldn't quite get it to reach her face. 

Suddenly, a new sound broke the silence. A high pitched whine, growing higher in frequency, droned over them until a burst of red pierced the cloud bank several hundred feet in front of the ship. The flare arced languidly before petering out into nothing.

"Well, no big surprise there," Jaresh murmured, turning to face the small group arrayed on the deck. 

"As our envoy has kindly informed us, Esravash has not agreed to any sort of armistace," he began, his voice growing in strength to reach the members of his crew who stood watch. "It's time to show her what it means to attack the Wind Whisperers."

A cry of support went up around the deck, airmen raising scimitars aloft chanting "Brightwind! Brightwind!" 

Ven glanced nervously at her own small crew --- Brim, Snipe, Jab, Mia --- all stood to her left watching the deck with varying degrees of fascination and worry. She thought back to the night before, when they'd met up in the Keep for an emergency meeting. 

"Look, this isn't any of our fight, but it's especially not any of yours," Ven had said. "Against my better judgement, I'll be out there with my brother for whatever happens. But truly, you all should consider taking his offer to keep out of this battle."

Heads were already shaking as she spoke. 

"You were with me in ancient freaky Q'barran temples," Brim said, grasping Ven's forearm warmly. "I'm here with you now. A healer is always useful in a fight."

"We'll all be safer if we stick together," Snipe nodded. 

"We're *fated* to stick together," Jab added. "If we're believing the all knowing matron out there." 

Mia only clapped her on the shoulder. 

"I'm never going to be done looking after you two," she smiled.

Back on the deck of the ship, Ven nervously checked that the sky staff was secure at her back. She felt guilty that she had a flyable recourse in case shit went sideways when her companions didn't. *Well, they have featherfall tokens,* she thought, knowing full well it wasn't the same. She looked up as Jaresh continued.

Ven felt it before she saw it. A whine in her inner ear, pressure in the back of her head. She'd felt it before, at Diamond Theatre in Sharn, in the apartment when they'd had *it* hidden in their walls.

*But how is it here, now?* she thought frantically, gazing around the wreckage of the charred deck. The presence was growing stronger, undeniable, stronger than it had ever been before. The mark on her shoulder throbbed violently. 

Slinging her skystaff beneath her, she took off from the ship, rocketing back up towards where the *Sunrise* was tucked into a fog bank. She was only half way there when the air rippled around her. 

Descending out from the clouds above was the largest ship Ven had ever seen. 

Plated, somehow, in metal, it looked like the *Iron Fortress* if the *Iron Fortress* had been three times as long and twice as wide. In its center, separating its fore and aft body, a massive, glass-like sphere bisected the ship. Though it was too small to see from this distance, Ven knew exactly what lay at that sphere's center, because emanating from it were lightning-like pulses of red energy, striking out at constant, irregular intervals against the glass container. But rather than escaping out, she saw it slide along the sphere's surface to nexus points --- four in a ring around its center, and two in line with the body of the ship, at the front and back of the sphere. 

It was obvious what the first four were powering --- extending out from those points, affixed to the exterior of the sphere, were four rods which jutted out into space. Through them ran the ship's ring. But Ven could see immediately this was no elemental ring. Because the ring itself was not air, fire or water. It was that same red, crackling energy expelled by the *dragonseye*. 

*He's found a way to harness it,* she thought, rage and horror washing over her. *He said it could power a district of Sharn...*

She felt the shame and embarrassment wash over her, the simple, businesslike nature in which she and her friends had been used. *It was never for powering homes,* she thought. *It was a weapon from the start*. 

As if on cue, the ship surged forward, and large batteries built into its side swiveled to life, barrels pointing in all directions. She saw the cascade of red against the sphere dim slightly as red bundles of energy came firing from the cannons like projectiles, arcing across the battlefield toward Jaresh's ships. 

*No! This can't be happening.* 

The lightning packets hit with destructive force, ripping holes through decks and sidings, energy crackling through the crews as they spasmed and collapsed, unable to rush and repair their now-leaking ships. 

Ven had no idea what she could possibly do against such a behemoth. But she knew the *Sunrise* was just out of sight in the clouds, and if Merrix's ship found it, the battle was over. Incredulous at herself, she swung her skystaff toward the ship, and began making a beeline for it. 

Drawing nearer, she saw something so strange she had to blink her eyes against the wind to confirm she wasn't hallucinating. Bodies, human-like individuals, seemed to be clustered around the exterior of the ship. They were clad in the same dark-grey of the ship's plating --- no, not clad. They were *warforged*. But unlike any she'd ever seen. Sturdier, larger. Seemingly magnetic, or otherwise stuck to the hull. Some were manning arcane batteries, while others seemed to have no discernible purpose. 

Several facts connected unceremoniously in her mind in that moment. The reapers stealing warforged body parts back in Sharn. The illegal, untraceable funds from heists. Both linked to Jab's mysterious, sketchy House d'Geneo. And, Ven realized now, to Merrix. 

*He needed money, and he needed parts. For whatever the fuck this is,* she thought with horror. 

She couldn't fathom why all this was necessary. Couldn't he just *hire* living warforged to carry out these duties? Why go to the trouble of maiming and dismembering the already downtrodden, newly freed veterans of the war?

She didn't have time to consider it, only had time for the rage to boil over, fire dancing around her hands as her staff brought her into range of the ship. She could see the words emblazoned on its side. *The Requiem*. 

*Fitting,* she thought bitterly. Then a projectile from an arcane cannon nearly ripped her from her staff. For a second, she thought it had, as her world violently disappeared into an infinite nothing. But then she crashed back into existence fifteen feet from where she'd been, Cinder --- balancing precariously on the staff in front of her, yipping in consternation. 

*Thanks buddy,* she thought as she began to veer violently, zigzagging to avoid the arcing trails of cannon fire that were pulsing off the ship in all directions. 

She figured the Dragonseye chamber at the center was a *bad* place to try to board, so despite the fact that her whole body seemed to be tugged invariably toward it, she skimmed across the ship's metal-clad surface until she reached what appeared to be an access hatch near the rear. She landed awkwardly, falling to her knees to avoid tumbling off the ship into the raging skies, and noted that several of the warforged clinging to the exterior seemed to turn, clocking her presence. 

*Time to go,* she thought, and sent a rivulet of fire at the lock on the hatch. 

When it was sufficiently melted a few panicked seconds later, she wrenched the hatch open, tumbled inside, and turned around to spit heat at the edges of the hatch, re-sealing it in her wake. 

*No turning back now.* 

Admittedly, she had no idea what the plan was now. Ideally, sabotage the ship in some appropriately dramatic way so as to cause it to plummet from the sky --- but not before she could get off it with her life. An unlikely dream. She hadn't seen anything thus far remotely resembling a weakness. Except the *dragonseye* itself. 

One way or another, this ship was being powered by that thing. 

*And I'm one of the few who can touch it without collapsing in agony.*

Lacking any better ideas, Ven glanced around the service corridor nervously, aimed toward the front of the ship, and began to walk.
