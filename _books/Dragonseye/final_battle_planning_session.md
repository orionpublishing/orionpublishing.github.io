# War 

"And this is the war room," Jaresh said, gesturing them into a long hall hewn in the rock face. The familiar sight of a map table filled its center, with a wooden carved surface depicting the islands of the Lhazaar Principalities in relief. More surprisingly, the islands themselves had little to no detail, yet swaths of the ocean were decorated with what looked like terrestrial features --- forests, mountains, rivers. 

"Interesting map," Brim ventured, leaning forward to get a better look. 

"Indeed," Jaresh said. "Territorial power works differently in the principalities. Sure, the islands themselves have resources, but few principalities have the strength to fully settle and island and defend it. Our power rests in our fleets, and our fleets are most effective at sea, not sitting duck at port."

Stepping around to the side of the table, Jaresh gestured to the ocean-bound features. 

"To the unsuspecting, the ocean is just a vast, flat horizon. But for us, the seas around these islands are known for their games. Fleets service and protect trade routes up and down through the islands, and some routes are vastly preferable to others. One *doesn't* want to have to sail here," he said, gesturing to a forest looking patch, "because the natural cavern formed by the mainland and this island forms a wind still zone in which thick fog often congregates."

"And these mountains?" Brim asked, sensing Jaresh wished nothing more than to continue. 

"Underwater mountains," he responded. "Invisible at the surface, but often lethal to larger vessels. A region to avoid, or, if you're clever enough, to draw enemies into." 

It had been several long minutes since Ven had spoken, but Brim saw her frustration boil over. 

"This is all well and good, but you've done nothing to explain how you intend to take on a twenty vessel fleet!" she exclaimed. 

Jaresh only smiled roguishly. 

"Love you, sister, but I can't go showing my cards at a critical juncture like this. Mother could have you spying for Esravash! And I don't know your friends."

Ven groaned, grumbling into silence. Jaresh held up a placating hand. 

"Okay, how about a taste. Look here." He pointed down to the bean-shaped island that marked Orthoss. 

"Lady Es is bringing her fleet here. She means to annihillate us in open combat. How would you respond to that?"

Ven rolled her eyes, but Brim could see the spark of strategy swimming behind them. 

"I'd uh... spread my fleet around? Force her to split up her own fleet? But that still leaves several of her vessels to each of yours."

Jaresh nodded. "Yes, a good start, but not complete. And that plan would leave Blackrock undefended --- Es could take it first, and hold my citizens hostage."

"How's your long range weaponry?" Snipe asked from the other side of the table. *Figures,* Brim thought. *He'd like this game*. 

Jaresh smiled knowingly. "Continue that thought."

Snipe paced forward, pointing to the many coves and inlets that lined Orthoss and its neighboring islands. 

"I'd do as Ven said, split the fleet, but not spread them to the winds. I'd hide them in all these coves. Close enough to Blackrock to come to its aid, or provide some cover, but far enough apart that her ships can't rely on brute force."

"Excellent," Jaresh clapped his hands. "We know this terrain better than anyone. Esravash is relying on overwhelming force, but that is only viable on an open battlefield. We'll be fighting from the shadows."

Brim was still troubled by all this.

"Doesn't she have airships, though? And more than you? She can root out the location of your ships from above, attack them from out of their range..."

"Yes, the airships are a thorny issue," Jaresh conceded. "But I assure you I have a bit of an ace up my sleeve on that front. Ah, here she is now!"

They all turned to see a dark skinned figure with familiar braids and halter top stride in. 

"Ah, the gangs all here," Vys said brightly. "Long time no see."

Brim gasped, catching herself. Ven looked like an anvil had hit her, while Snipe smirked annoyingly from the other side of the great table. 

"What the hell are you doing here," Ven stammered. 

"I owe your brother a favor," she replied lightly. "Like many others, he brought me some valuable information. *Very valuable.* But rather than gold or silver, he asked for my aid at some point in the future. And now he's cashed it in."

"What exactly can you do?" Brim blurted, before hastily adding "Sorry- I just mean, if you deal primarily in lore..." 

"No offense taken Brim," Vys smiled. "Suffice it to say, I do have some talents outside of academia --- though my records of past battles have not been unhelpful, I think." 

"Es gets here tomorrow," Jaresh said, bouncing on his heels. "If you all stick around, you'll see Vys's talents for yourself. For now, you'll have to trust that I have things under control."

Ven stepped toward Jaresh. Brim could read the fear, the unspoken history of pain in her eyes. 

"It's not just about logistics," she said, pleading. "Solia says Es will stop at nothing to put your head on a spike. It's *personal* for her. And... it goes beyond a vendetta. The Korth Edicts are being broken. A sovereign Principality is being invaded. Lyrandar agents may kill or capture members of your Deneith bodyguards, stacking an intrine house war onto a reignition of the *Last War*. Is one airship really worth all that?"

She reached out and gripped his forearm. 

"Leave the airship. Retreat with your fleet. You know these waters. If she *still* chases you, you have every right to fight back, and every principality will come to your aid, the houses will take your side. Her only *legal* justification here is the recovery of stolen property---" 

"Stop," Jaresh cut her off. "You have no idea what the *Sunrise* is worth."

"I understand that an airship gave you the ability to build a fleet--"

Jaresh pulled away from her grasp, his expression darkening. 

"One day, soon, I will show you why you don't understand," he said, "but right now, you either need to trust me, or leave."

Silence hung in the air for a long moment, before Vys clapped her hands. 

"I think you should tell her," Vys said, cutting through the tension. "What's the harm?" 

Jaresh gave her a long look, an unspoken conversation passing between them. 

"Fine," he shrugged. "I suppose it's nothing Es doesn't already know."

Turning to face those at the table, Jaresh reached out and placed a marker over Orthoss. A small airship, held aloft by a thin wooden stake worked into a flat base. 

"You've all been led to believe that Esravash d'Lyrandar --- head of one of the twelve houses, cunning, vicious, and ambitious --- is risking all she is over nothing more than pride," he began, letting his arm sweep across the map. 

"Pride has nothing to do with it. She *must* recover the *Sunrise*, and soon. Because... the *Sunrise* is not an airship."

His eyes swept the room, twinkling, watching for their reactions. 

"Uh... how so?" Brim asked, spurring him to end the grand pause. 

"My beloved ship is able to soar our skies, yes," Jaresh picked up. "But that was not its original intent. *Sunrise* was designed to go much further than that. Beyond Eberron." 

"You mean... to space?" Snipe asked, incredulous. 

Jaresh smiled wide. "Indeed, to space. To the Ring of Siberys and the twelve moons beyond." 

"That's impossible," Ven murmured quietly, her eyes boring a hole into the tabletop. 

"Not at all," Vys interjected. "In fact, Aundair and Karrnath are already up there, mucking about!" 

"You're fucking kidding," Snipe said. "Karrnath is in space?" 

"It's all a bit hush hush at the moment," Jaresh conceded, "But at the highest levels, all of the five nations are aware of it. Aundair got there first. In today's most adorable news, several of their archmages brokered a deal with some arch-fey. From what I hear, they have incredible, gorgeous ships --- living ships --- inhabited by some being akin to a dryad. It keeps them safe out there, and produces the energy needed to escape Eberron's pull." 

"And Karrnath," Vys picked up, "got there using the undead, rather predictably. They actually had no real interest in space during the war, *until* they heard Aundair had breached the great beyond. As soon as that happened, space became the next battleground of the war. They knew that if they could establish a military presence at strategic locations around the planet, the next phase of the Last War would be theirs to win." 

Brim swallowed nervously. "When you say they used the undead...?"

Vys laughed. "Yes, it's all a bit squeamish to most. You all know of course about Karrnath's raising of undead troops during the Last War. It turns out, the energy siphoned from the plane of Mabar by the undead could also be harnessed into an engine that can push a ship to space. Ugly fuckers, but they get the job done."

Ven was still shaking her head slowly, but Brim could see the gears turning. 

"So, it's a race," she said quietly. "And Esravash wants in?" 

"More than that," Jaresh said, nodding. "It's actually Breland that wants in. Breland saw Aundair and Karrnath make it up using methods they couldn't simply copy --- they had no connection to the fey, nor the ability or balls to use undead. The only technology they could build on was Lyrandar airships." 

"... So Breland cuts a deal with Lyrandar... and probably Cannith and Zilargo, too, to push airship development until one could get to space," Ven concluded. 

"Exactly!" Jaresh clapped. "So now, when I say the *Sunrise* is important...." 

Brim gasped, then immediately looked down in embarrassment. She'd been following fine, but the final connection had just dropped on her like a wayward spark off the forge. 

But Ven was frowning. 

"Is *Sunrise* space-worthy? Have you been *going to space?* Because it doesn't *sound* like you've been to space."

"Sadly, no. The *Sunrise* has likely the most complex, ingenious arcane matrix of any machine ever devised. Such a matrix would be needed to adequately funnel the energy needed to power the ship through it without tearing it apart."

"Why haven't they just built another one in the years you've had this one?"

"Because the gnome who devised that matrix, who installed it in the *Sunrise*, and who has every copy of the plans is here with me," Jaresh smiled. "His name is Grismarc Fallowdwell. All those years ago, I woo'd him into a dream, of a world where we could soar the heavens free of the shackles of House politics or national warmongering."

"So what's missing?" Jab asked from the end of the table. "Why haven't you gone to space?" 

"The same problem that was vexing Grismarc and the rest of the King's Argosy --- that's what King Boranel named the secret consortium of top Lyrandar, Cannith, and Zil engineers working on this --- at the time: Not enough power. We've tried every terrestrial source known. Tried stacking elemental rings, too unstable. Tried extra dragonshards, but even networked together, they only provide so much juice."

Brim shot Ven a look and saw Ven staring back in alarm. A glance over at Jab and Snipe confirmed the same thing. 

Ven spoke very slowly, appearing to choose her words one by one. 

"So, you're saying... if you had a mobile, stable power source of great strength... you could plug it into the *Sunrise*... and fly to space."

"Well, I'm sure any novel power source would take some fiddling to integrate but uh, yeah, pretty much." Jaresh said. 

"Hm," Ven said, then shut her mouth into a thin line and said nothing more. 

----- 

Ven was standing on one of the balconies of Blackrock Keep's upper levels, staring out at the twinkling lanterns dotting the town and reflecting erratically off the cove's choppy water, when Vys slid into place next to her. 

"A lot to take in, isn't it," she said. 

Ven wasn't sure how to respond. The last several hours had passed in a blur, her anxieties, still buzzing at the base of her skull, still twitching at fingers she was nearly done chewing the nails off of, had mixed thoroughly with equal parts confusion, awe, and fear. And somewhere in all of that was the reality that her brother was alive, was *here*, after all this time. 

Elation --- and anger, too. She knew it was irrational; by the time Jaresh could've made any attempts to find her or reach out, she'd too absconded her home, taken to an untraceable life in the countryside of a continent dragging through an unwinnable civil war. 

Well, not untraceable for her mother, but that was different. Ven almost had to laugh --- she'd discovered her mother had been keeping tabs on her just days before learning that the same had evidently always been true for Jaresh as well. 

She turned to face Vys, struggling to not back away despite the young woman's warm, welcoming demeanor. Tarkanan's arrival at Tempest Isle continued to shake her, the callousness with which Thora, and even Vys, had discounted the suffering doled out in Thora's quest to fulfill some strand of some prophecy irked her. There was something *off* about her, though Ven could not quite grasp it.

"Yes, it's a lot to take in," she said, hoping the woman would leave her alone. But instead, Vys turned to lean against the balcony, gazing out at the waters as the sky above darkened into night. 

"Your brother is a good man," she said. "And that's coming from someone who is not generally in the position of caring, nor judging, men's goodness."

*Of course he's good*, Ven thought, annoyed, before taking a breath and remembering that it had been a decade since she'd seen him. *People change,* she thought. *I certainly have.* 

"Thanks," she said. "I guess that's good to know, if I'm going to be fighting a war for him tomorrow."

"Oh, nothing so grand as a war," Vys said. "I have cataloged many wars. Wars are dirty, horrid things. Protracted, like a disease that eats away at your limbs one by one. Better to amputate the arm, usually, but a war commits you too deeply to do it. You've already given up control of the surgeon's saw. All you can do is watch it spread, wait to see if it kills the host." 

Ven shuddered. 

"And this isn't like that?" 

"No," Vys smiled. "This is a battle. Battles are glorious, soaring creatures. Full of thrill, full of purpose. For a soldier in battle, the thrill of killing is no shameful thing, for a battle is kill or be killed, with none of the pesky moralizing of whether your war is just or isn't. Battle is a hunt, a game of skill and chance, cunning and brute strength."

"This battle could lead to a war," Ven murmured quietly, uncomfortable with the metaphors.

"Mm, perhaps," Vys said. "But only if you let it. The only way this battle leads to war is if neither side wins decisively. If either of you are crushed soundly, the victor will write the history. If it is your enemy, you all were naught but a small insurgency rightfully wiped out. If it is you, then Lyrandar was a mercantile house overextended, rightfully put back in its place."

"But the other houses---"

"Have no interest in themselves engaging in war, nor from stopping their competitors from drowning in one. And the five nations are bruised and battered from decades of war; none will take up arms again simply to chastise a house they now rely on so fully as would bring about their own collapse were they to loose its support."

*Damn,* Ven thought, mulling it over. 

"Do you really think we have any chance against them?" Ven asked after a long silence, unsure if she wanted the Matron of Whispers' honest answer. 

Vys shrugged lightly, adjusting the straps of her halter. 

"I've seen stranger things happen," she responded. "You're outnumbered, yes, but we are clever, we have terrain advantage, and most importantly, we have a hostage."

"Hostage?"

"*Sunrise*, my dear," Vys said. "We're flying into battle on a ship your enemy cannot afford to destroy. And if in the course of this fight, it comes to blowing it up ourselves... well, in a way, we've still won, no?"

She left Ven then, patting her lightly on the shoulder. Ven stayed at the balcony for some minutes more, searching for answers to the roiling swirl of her emotions in the cresting waves, before giving up and stepping inside.
