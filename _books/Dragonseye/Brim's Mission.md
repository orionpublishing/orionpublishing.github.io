# Brim's Mission

It had been a sunny, crisp fall day when Brimstone's father gathered his family about their dinner table and informed them they would have to close the forge within the year. 

Brim had known there was trouble; from her position in the forge, she watched as fewer and fewer customers from the neighboring villages stepped through their honeycomb-styled iron doorway. She'd seen her father sneak out on the weekends --- and upon following him, once, discovered him pleading at his neighbors doors for orders. 

Khorvwares Inc. was doing more than offering the goods her family once provided --- farm tools, metal-worked home supports, the occasional weapon, cutlery and dishware --- at severely discounted prices. Its goods had replaced the majority of the industries in the region. The squeeze was hitting everyone, as mineworkers, woodworkers, and craftsmen of all kind found themselves out of work. 

The downward spiral into poverty played out before Brimstone's eyes as if in slow motion, year after year of decline. Unable to buy her father's tools --- tools that used to serve families for generations --- now the villagers of her home were forced to buy mass produced tools from Khorvwares. They simply could not afford her father's rates, rates set only high enough to keep food on the Malleary table.

Of course, the Khorvwares goods broke down in months, or at most, years. Brim had long complained incredulously to her father that in the end, people were spending much, much more to replace their mass-produced tools. But her father had only shaken his head sadly. 

"That may be true, but they have not the coin on hand to avoid it." 

Despite her father's slow sink into despondency, Brim had not given up. She'd tried establishing a line of credit with a Kundarak bank, but villagers from the countryside were not, it turned out, high on the list for loans. 

She tried to convince her father to offer deferred payments, to let customers pay in installments. But Brim's mother was adamantly opposed. Whatever they did as a family to survive, they would not go into debt, would not let their tools walk out the door unpaid for. The risk of default was far too high.
