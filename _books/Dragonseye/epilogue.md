# Epilogue 

Snipe crouched in what appeared to be a barren, empty cargo bay aboard the monstrous ship calling itself *Requiem*. He was, for the moment, invisible. 

Partway across the barren, metal floor of the cavernous room, a standoff was underway, triangular. Ven frozen in place at its precipice. A woman he could only assume was Esravash d'Lyrandar at another point, foot grinding into Ven's older brother. And at the third, Merrix d'Cannith — 2000 galifars-for-his-silence Merrix d'Cannith — with Brim and Jab unmoving at his feet. 

Snipe, as he always did, calculated. His options were not good. Any aggressive action he took, he knew, would break the invisibility on him, rendering him just another hostage. And besides, he had little doubt that dragonmarked-house patriarchs and matriarchs would not have some sort of shielding that could easily deflect a bolt from his crossbow.

As long as everyone was alive, he'd bide his time and watch. 

Very suddenly, everyone was *not* alive. In a fluid motion, Esravash had ended Jaresh, stepped to Brim, and slit her throat as well. Only Jab remained upright — though Snipe noticed an unusual sheen to his friend's eye. Something foreign. He only remained untouched at Merrix's orders. *Not promising,* Snipe thought, ignoring the horror for a moment in favor of strategic planning. 

Still crouched, frozen, in place, Snipe watched as Merrix seemingly commanded Jab into action, moving to exit the room arm-in-arm with the Lyrandar scion. He watched as Ven, released from her hold, scrambled forward, grabbing at Jaresh and Brim, holding them close. Calculations churned, as Jab stepped closer, spear raised. 

And then, an explosion. Snipe saw white as his head cracked against the metal backing of the room. Jab was not too far to his left, rubbing his temple the same. And across from them both, Ven had clutched her friends and family to her, called that fox from hers, and disappeared. 

Somewhere in the recesses of Snipe's shellshocked mind, a calculation concluded. He was aboard this ship, one which, based on the conversation that had transpired, was about to launch into space. Jab was safe — safe enough, *alive*, and being kept that way, albeit in an altered mental state — and Ven, Brim, and Jaresh were gone. 

All that was left at this point to do was help his friends as best he could. And that meant engaging in some espionage. That was good. He was good at espionage. He waited until Jab's colorless form stood, and moved mechanically to the door Merrix had departed. Snipe slipped through behind him. 

*They'll come for us,* he thought, viciously, violently, forcing himself for the first time in his life to place absolute trust in someone else. *They'll come for us, and when they get here, I'll have everything we need to break us all out.* 


And so he set to work.
