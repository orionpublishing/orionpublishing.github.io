<h2 id="jannis">Jannis</h2>

<p>Jannis strapped himself into the pilot’s seat of the <em>Khebet</em>, Edaar sliding into the nav-comms and firing station next to him.</p>

<p>“I known you six years now Jannis, not once you ever ask me for no favor. I don’t know whether to be honored or scared shitless for whatever this is.”</p>

<p>“For now, neither, but at some point it might be both,” Jannis grunted. He flicked on the control panels. “Sorry for all the crap cluttering the FCS, I haven’t flown with a second in a long time.”</p>

<p><em>Khebet</em> was a sleek vessel, a high end racer which Jannis had retrofitted with Theseusean effort over the years. Behind the cockpit, a low cabin held two bunks and a tiny kitchenette — so rarely used that the only working component was the coffee dispenser. Jannis hadn’t bought <em>Khebet</em> for comfort. It was the sole object he’d ever purchased with flare race earnings, and he did so because it was fast, and because it had the best cloaking capabilities available outside the SGE navy.</p>

<p>“I cannot believe you've been hiding this beauty from me,” Edaar complained, tapping at his screens reverently. “It's a wonder, even without your mods. And once I get this workspace cleared up—” with a flourish, the targeting systems came online, cleared of the old files and nav-calculations Jannis had carelessly swiped to his unused station—“Shit! This <em>chica</em> is loaded! Who you fighting wars with in this galaxy, brother?”</p>

<p>Jannis didn't quite respond, grunting noncommittally as he powered up the ships engines. “You know how to use those?”</p>

<p>“Yeesss… will I have to?”</p>

<p>Jannis shrugged. “Hopefully not… and you have the crossbow?”</p>

<p>Edaar shook his head, muttering fearfully, but pulled out the small hand crossbow as requested. It had a plastic printed grip, but the shaft was real wood. Arcane sigils lined the sides of the shaft, and from inside the grip, the soft blue glow of an Eneregium pellet could be seen, pulsing in the dim cabin.</p>

<p>“I don’t know why we still call these crossbows,” Edaar mused. “Where’s the crossbar? Where’s the bowstring?”</p>

<p>“They were both there before,” Jannis replied, though he suspected Edaar’s query was largely rhetorical. “At first Eneregium was used to enhance the striking force of traditional bows, but eventually they realized they could accelerate projectiles down the shaft with Eneregium alone.”</p>

<p>“And weaving,” Edaar added.</p>

<p>“And weaving,” Jannis agreed, bitterly.</p>

<p>“I’m liking this favor of yours less and less,” Edaar said.</p>

<p>“<em>Kebet</em> to <em>Farudan</em>, releasing docking clamps, retracting umbilical,” Jannis replied, activating his comms to the station. Edaar laughed as the ship shuddered slightly under their release from the station.</p>

<p>“Roger <em>Kebet</em>, you are cleared to egress station docking space under heading 0700, keep an eye for the tanker at position 004:015:0095 on your way out.”</p>

<p>“I get it,” Edaar laughed. “No backing out now.”</p>

<p>Jannis shot him a small grin, before flicking the comms again. “Understood <em>Farudan</em>, see you next auction. <em>Khebet</em> out.”</p>

<p>He thought he heard a whispered “crazy motherfucker” slip through the comms channel from the control room before the connection went dead.</p>

<p>Smoothly tacking out from the station, he swooped gracefully around the tanker, hulking in the station’s shadow, and brought them out into open space.</p>

<p>“Guess I get to find out where we’re going now?” Edaar wagered.</p>

<p>“Yep,” Jannis said. He pulled up the guidance system, and selected a trail of wayfinders that snaked out deep into the galaxy’s outer reaches.</p>

<p>Edaar whistled.  “Damn, way out there. You got enough E in your core for that?”</p>

<p>Jannis grimaced. Eneregium wasn’t cheap, even for him. But he nodded. “And enough credits in my account to pay the wayfinder tolls,” he replied.</p>

<p>Edaar pinched his fingers, zooming in on their destination system. “I see why you asked for the crossbow.”</p>

<p>“All systems ready?”</p>

<p>Edaar immediately fell into flight ops mode. “Roger <em>capitán</em> — ship is healthy. This is quite a few jumps. Should we go under?”</p>

<p>“Can you handle without?”</p>

<p>“Yes, but I charge you extra.”</p>

<p>Jannis rolled his eyes, then confirmed their path, and pressed the pulsing red button: \texttt{JUMP*.</p>

<hr />

<p>What followed could only be described as hell—for most anyone in the galaxy. Jannis and Edaar, their entire atomic structure, and that of their ship, folded in upon themselves to the nothing more than quarks and spins, before being destroyed and  reconstituted in the backwash of the massive tetrahedral devices that lurked in the shadow of the galaxy's more traditional Energium sources: star forming regions.</p>

<p>They burst, gasping, into each of these locales, before they and their ship once again disintegrated, paying the tolls to the wayfinders before being beamed on to the next, like thoughts across neurons. Life, followed by excruciating death, ten times over. The average pilot would alternatively die, faint, puke, or otherwise evacuate their bowels in the face of this repeated torture.</p>

<p>Jannis and Edaar simply grunted through it. They weren't the only pilots in the galaxy with the training. Smugglers often relied on multi-wayfinder jumps to evade the various authorities spread across star systems. But only a flare racer knew the particular gut wrench of jumping out of the galactic center. No one knew why, but the excessive energy floating about seemed to make the process more… painful, and involved, than usual.</p>

<p>After seven gut wrenching disintegrations, reconstitutions, and further disintegrations, the <em>Khebet</em> finally emerged, in a burst, into orbit around the smuggling den of the planet Semaroid. Without any shame, the two pilots took their moments to heave and gasp, and, if necessary, vomit into waiting vacuum tubes.</p>

<p>“Extra, double,” Edaar wheezed out. “That was probably the longest jump sequence I've ever done.”</p>

<p>“It's really not that bad,” Jannis deadpanned, before involuntarily gagging.</p>

<p>Unlike the rest of the civilized galaxy, Semaroid did not have a resident space station in orbit. They'd have to go planetside. Going planetside was expensive. Edaar did not seem concerened about Jannis's finances, but Jannis glanced guiltily at his wristpad. He could pay the docking fees… but getting <em>Khebet</em> skyward again would require some additional funding. He tried not to think of who he'd have to swindle on this planet to get it.</p>

<p>“I only been to the Outer Reaches once or twice brother,” Edaar warned. “Not sure I know what to expect down there.”</p>

<p>“It's not so different than Farudan,” Jannis said. “Keep your wits about you… and always shoot first, if you have to.”</p>

<p>With that, he calculated a descent orbit that would tear them through Semaroid's atmosphere without skipping off it or burning up. One which, if all went well, would bring them subsonic over a relative desert. That would give him plenty of time to extend <em>Khebet</em>'s conventional wings, bringing them in for a vertical landing on a spacepad in Drala.</p>

<p>Drala was, for all intents and purposes, the last place one would want to park one's ship. But Jannis didn't plan on being planetside for long, and the launch pad provided the opportunity for a quick egress if things went south.</p>

<p>Both pilots gripped their seatrests as <em>Khebet</em> descended through the atmosphere, red, then white-hot flames engulfing the vessel as its heat-shielding panels deflected the worst of the atmosphere's friction. Weaving or no, descending into atmo remained one of the most tense, most dangerous aspect of space travel. More dangerous than launch. It's why many preferred to keep to the stations. But Jannis's treasure lurked on the planet's surface.</p>

<p>After several minutes of shuddering, the red-hot glow outside the windows faded to the dusty orange-blue of the sky. Jannis threw the reverse thrusters into action, fighting their direction of motion, eventually righting them in Semaroid's sky. They began to descend, the autopilot systems targeting an upright landing on one of the launch pads that spread out from the spaceport's edges like spokes on a wheel.</p>

<p>As they descended, the four wings of the craft crept backward from their flight position, extruding landing pads below their tips. With a thud, they touched down, and the engines sputtered and flickered out of use.</p>

<p>Almost immediately, upon connecting to the spaceport's network, Jannis and Edaar's nav-screens were overrun with advertisements for the gambling houses and brothels in the port. Edaar shielded his eyes and turned away in overwrought disgust as several were direct and salacious in their attempts. Jannis simply swiped the ads aside, instead selecting several options from the station menu, transferring the credits necessary to have his ship refueled. He had enough hypergolic fuel to reach orbit once he could activate the scramjet, but he couldn't do <em>that</em> until their launch reached supersonic speeds in the upper atmosphere. Getting off ground required conventional approaches.</p>

<p>In this, Semaroid's spaceport operated like many others — rocket boosters would be attached to his ship, pre-fueled, and ready to launch them to mid-atmo, where they would separate and fall away, and where his scramjets would take over, followed by the hypergolic engines. The boosters would fall under their own parachutes and be recovered by the launch service.</p>

<p>Jannis felt Edaar's gaze on him, as the man drew the crossbow and held it protectively against his own waist.</p>

<p>“Whatever we do here, we gotta stay alive till dockside attaches our boosters,” Edaar said, a warning tone in his voice.</p>

<p>“Don't worry,” Jannis said. “It'll take us a while to get where we're going anyway.”</p>

<p>“That still makes me worry brother. Means it will take us <em>a while</em> to get back when this goes tits up.”</p>

<p>“There's no pleasing you. C'mon, let's go.”</p>

<p>Jannis dropped out of his seat, climbing down a ceiling ladder through his bunk space, and then sliding down a long ladder that ran along the inside top of the ship. Near the base, he spun open a small airlock hatch, stuffing himself next to Edaar as the man closed the hatch behind them. He opened the outer hatch, which was near the base of the ship but still a good thirty feet off the ground given the fins of the ship supporting them.</p>

<p>He looked out over the pads for a moment, before a helpful droid rolled an extendible ladder over to the ship. He and Edaar climbed down. Swiping from his holo-tab, Jannis tipped the droid and insinuated, via a few binary bytes, that more credits would follow if it kept the ladder in place.</p>

<p>“I've been looking for something,” he said to Edaar, as they crossed the landing pad. “I think I'm close. But there's a piece missing from my picture, and someone on this planet has it.”</p>

<p>Edaar groaned. “I'm terrible at extortion Jannis, you know this. I'm a puppy dog.”</p>

<p>“I'll do the talking. You just hold the crossbow,” Jannis responded.</p>
