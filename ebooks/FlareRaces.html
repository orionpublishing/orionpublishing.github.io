    <h1>The Flare Races</h1>
    <article><h1 id="prologue">Prologue</h1>

<p>Jannis Tarkadin sat in a coffin at the center of the galaxy, counting down the seconds until his death. Just behind his ship, past thick layers of radiation shielding, swirled the accretion disk that fed <em>Gargantuan</em>, the galaxy’s super massive black hole.</p>

<p>Technically the edge of the disk was a nearly-incomprehensible distance away in human terms; the intervening space was larger than most star systems. But that detail wouldn’t stop the waves of γ-radiation from frying him instantly were it not for the shielding. And it certainly wouldn’t stop a <em>flare</em> from frying him <em>and</em> his ship, shielding or no.</p>

<p>Officially, Jannis was floating at <em>Mark V</em>, a location 15 percent inward of the outer edge of the Galactic Exclusion Zone — so defined because within it, a standard ship could not protect its inhabitants from the radiation field.</p>

<p>Unofficially — as he glanced at the readouts on the panel before him — he saw he had drifted inward several hundred additional stellar units. That was fine. A flare would kill him anyway, and being closer in would boost his siphon.</p>

<p>As if on cue, Jannis heard a beep and glanced over at his siphon readings. His tanks were at nearly 60 percent, meaning he had to hold on for roughly ten more minutes before he could disengage, sending his screamer — the small, barely armored, scrapped-together-but-nonetheless-<em>exceedingly</em>-fast ship in which he was currently crammed — out of the bottom of the heavily armored junker, leaving it behind as he blasted himself and his precious cargo out of the exclusion zone.</p>

<p>Both the junker, and the screamer tucked in its belly, had no named designations — they were designed to be single use. Inhabitants of the galaxy were not typically in the habit of constructing single-use space ships, but these represented a tiny fraction of what he’d earn if he got his cargo safely out of the zone and into the waiting hands of the Second Galactic Empire. Or the highest bidder. The two were usually the same.</p>

<p>A different beeping, two overlapping, discordant tones,  one slightly more frantic in tenor, began pulsing from a different screen. His accretion disk monitors. One he silenced with a tap; it was warning about a steady increase in radiation above safety limits, which he was expecting, given his inward drift. The other was more concerning.</p>

<p>Whenever a particularly large, viscous clump of superheated matter within the otherwise fairly smooth accretion disk finally fell into <em>Gargantuan</em>, it produced a massive burst of energy. A flare. A flare meant death for anyone in, or near, the GEZ.</p>

<p>Star systems close to the galactic center could monitor the disk for potential flares using large, highly complex telescopes… but electromagnetic signals could not pierce the wash of electromagnetic energy in the zone, so Jannis was on his own. He had only several basic sensors that could roughly indicate a possible incoming flare. He also had one that could detect the leading wave of a flare, but he’d already disabled that one. If it triggered, he was already dead.</p>

<p>He looked back to the siphon screens, which tracked how much Eneregium he had gathered. 73 percent. Enough to buy most spacers out of a life debt.  Enough to buy a small moon, in the right part of the galaxy.</p>

<p>Still he held on, eyes darting to the flare sensors. The Oracle he’d seen had predicted this should be a clean run — no flares — but if he had to count on two hands, it would be easier count the number of pilots given an accurate prediction from the oracles than those who hadn’t. Put another way, the survival rate per run for pilots who took part in the flare races was around 17 percent. That was why nearly every pilot who'd survived their race had never gone back in. Except Jannis.</p>

<hr />

<p>Sweat began to pool on Jannis’s face. His ship had no atificial gravity, so it didn’t drip into his eyes, but he wiped it away nonetheless. 84 percent.</p>

<p>The junker gave a pained shudder, sensors complaining about differential forces on the ship body exceeding limits. Grinding his teeth in frustration, he fired up the junker's thrusters and pushed himself back out toward the nominal <em>Mark V</em> position.</p>

<p><em>Damn hole,</em> he thought, <em>has to fuck me up with both radiation</em> and <em>gravity.</em></p>

<p>The siphon’s rate noticeably decreased as he flew, and he cursed again. Something was coming. He could feel it in his bones. The adrenaline had started to build, the edge of death sidling up next to him in the cramped cockpit, his finger hovering over the button that would bail him out of this hellhole. But not yet.</p>

<p>The interior of the screamer was only large enough barely to fit Jannis, his body extended in a standing — or laying, since there was no preferred direction — orientation. Just below his feet, his siphon tanks, each also roughly the size of a human, were stacked to the back of the ship. The front of the ship was above his head, but to save him straining his neck, the console of small screens were mounted in front of his face, while a small set of manual controls — a joystick and accelerator —  extended from under the console at arm level.</p>

<p>He reached underneath the console and pulled out a small holo-tablet. Its screen was almost completely frazzled by the overlapping matrix lines, but the reading he was seeking was there, buried in the noise. Just a little bit longer and he'd have it. He locked the device and stowed it.</p>

<p>The frantic beeping of the flare monitor turned into a steady whine. <em>Flare imminent.</em> Jannis growled. 94 percent. It was time to improvise.</p>

<p>The screamer had no windows — or rather, its cockpit screens revealed only the dark interior of the Junker's hangar bay. There was no point in trying to mount cameras outside the junker; they would simply fry, or return an alien image dominated by streaking bands caused by cosmic rays and high energy particles slashing across the detector.</p>

<p>He knew that most pilots would've bailed and screamed out by now. Flares were somewhat directional, but a racer's sensors were nowhere near accurate enough to predict their trajectories. When the sensor flatlined, you bailed.</p>

<p>Only Jannis didn't bail. He reached out and fumbled for the switch that silenced the alarm, cutting it off like a spacer ejected from an airlock. He reached out and grabbed the joystick, flipping up the safety and jamming his thumb into the switch for manual control.</p>

<p>The ship shuddered around him as the autoguiding thrusters disengaged. He felt a flutter in the pit of his stomach as the ship began accelerating back inward toward <em>Garganutan</em>, having been left idly in its gravitational field.</p>

<p>He flared the accelerator and pulled back on the joystick, sending the junker into a wide turn, then flashed the thrusters. He still had fuel left — most pilots, by training, burned straight to <em>Mark V</em> using their junker's full reserves, to maximize time siphoning. Jannis had instead drifted in on coast, saving fuel. One of many small tricks one could only learn by being stupid enough to try this game more than once.</p>

<p>Burning hard, his junker rattled its way around <em>Gargantuan</em>. Flares being pseudo directional as they were, a flatline sensor in one location meant that another might be safer. He had no possible way to pick a direction; he chose randomly, letting instinct guide him.</p>

<p>96 percent. By staying in the exclusion zone, he could still siphon, but his increased velocity decreased the rate. <em>Still, better to be alive,</em> he thought.</p>

<p>His console screen buzzed, informing him the Junker was now out of fuel. He had a significant transverse velocity now, but not enough to maintain a circular orbit at this distance from Gargantuan. As he moved, his orbital radius would drift inward toward the supermassive black hole.</p>

<p><em>All part of the plan,</em> he thought. <em>The crazy, stupid plan, but still.</em> Flares from the accretion disk tended to fan out, filling larger areas of space as they went. So ironically, spiralling closer in meant a better chance of avoiding its tendril.</p>

<p>The computerized voice called out.</p>

<p>``<em>Mark VI</em>, mark,'' indicating he had already drifted in another five percent. Jannis knew he'd now entered the region in which stray particle and radiation pressure was actually strong enough to buffet the ship. He could hear micrometeorite impacts pinging against the outer hull of the junker. At this distance, millions of high energy particles per second, which slipped through his now-inadequate shielding, were passing through his body. Many would pass straight through, their cross section of interaction far smaller then his body's cells. But some tiny fraction would be perfectly aligned to strike the structure of his DNA, damaging a few cells. Damage which could easily bring about a cancer. Through the shaking, he read off the siphon. 98 percent.</p>

<p>He itched to check his holo-tab, but had no time. He had to assume that forcing the closer orbit would help.</p>

<p>Instead, he prepped himself for scream-out. He had no fuel to boost to a larger orbit, so he'd be screaming out from far deeper in the well than most. He tugged the joystick, activating the lateral thrusters and rotating the junker to be once again oriented radially with <em>Gargantuan</em>. Then he pulled off the safety cover of the singular physical switch on his screen-based console. <em>EJECT.</em></p>

<p>Fingers twitching above it, he watched the siphon. 99 percent. He had no idea if he'd escaped the flare's trajectory. Against his better judgement, he flipped back on the sensor. It whined for a moment, flatlining, before reverting to a frantic beep.</p>

<p><em>Okay,</em> he thought. <em>Better than before, at least.</em></p>

<p>Suddenly, klaxons fired off around the cramped cabin. The several at play confused him for a split second, before realizing he'd flipped back on the actual flare detectors, which had mixed with the alarm of the siphons reaching 100 percent.</p>

<p><em>Time to go,</em> he thought, before slamming a hand down on the eject button.</p>

<hr />

<p>Nothing happened.</p>

<hr />

<p>He pressed it again, waiting for the characteristic clunk of the hangar bays opening, followed by the jerk of the hanger arms thrusting the screamer out into the void, followed by the immediate $g$-force of thrust pushing him back as the screamer burned hot and dirty for the exits. None of it came.</p>

<p><em>Bik'r</em>, he cursed violently, feeling death constricting at his chest, blurring his vision. Breathing through his panic, he reached under the screen console to where the computer system's core mounted into the ship controls. He clutched at it and, finding purchase, ripped it out.</p>

<p>Immediately, all of his console screens went dark, and the cockpit dropped into near-total darkness, the only dim light being cast by the emergency strips.</p>

<p>Grasping within the bramble of shorn wires and sparking electricity left behind where the module had een, his fingers searched for the life saving, cool metal touch of the manual escape handle.</p>

<p><em>Where is it?</em></p>

<p>He desperately rooted around, the abject fear that his lender for this run had cut one too many corners on the ship construction and a manual handle hadn't been added. Streaks began to dance across his vision like fireworks — particles that were now piercing both hulls, and, he knew, his body. A sort of anti-tunnel vision took him, the edges of his vision lit up while the center of his vision darkened.</p>

<p>But as he wrung his hand through the narrow space for what felt like the hundreth time, his fingers wrapped around the cool metal of the handle, and he yanked it with what was left of his sanity, and he heard the lifeblood of clanks and bangs as the screamer was ejected into space and streamed forward into the night.</p>

<h2 id="jannis">Jannis</h2>

<p>Jannis walked into the <em>Captain's Quarters Cantina</em> to the sound of cheers. The place was a dump, as always, but it had been wholly commandeered by flare pilots and flare pilots in training.</p>

<p>Any pilot who survived their race would be welcomed with a cheer in this place. Jannis usually got a standing ovation.</p>

<p>Glancing around the room, he saw several veterans of the flare races sitting at tables and seeming to enjoy the fetid swill the Cantina served.</p>

<p>It was odd. But he knew most volunteers for the races were either destitute, recently-liberated slaves, indentured with life debts, or those being blackmailed into it. If you survived… well, the credits were nice, but you didn't become an aristocrat overnight. Nor did you lose your taste for dive swill, so it seemed.</p>

<p>Jannis wound his way through the room, politely dodging claps to the shoulder and calls for him to sit down. He arrived finally at a small table in the rear of the joint, one held up by seal-tape and, probably, spit.</p>

<p>“Ayy, the god-touched returns!” came the jovial welcome from Edaar Velaguates — flare veteran, now instructor. “<em>Por favor dime que compraste una buena chica</em>…”</p>

<p>Jannis sat down with a grunt, pulling off his cloth cap to let his shaggy hair hang down around his face. Edaar maintained a fiesty table, but he was an actual veteran, unlike most in the bar, and somehow his ribbing rang less remora-ish than others. At minimum, he'd never slammed Jannis into a wall and demanded he reveal his <em>secret</em>.</p>

<p>“The answer's the same every time Edaar,” Jannis replied, “If I had any interest in life's finer things, I wouldn't be at the Quarters with you.”</p>

<p>Edaar laughed uproariously, despite having heard the line a dozen times.</p>

<p>“Fine <em>hombre</em>,” he said, as his wheezing died down. “Meet my new friends. And by that I mean <em>your</em> new friends.”</p>

<p>Jannis nodded begrudgingly at the assembled crew at the table, who looked no older than sixteen or seventeen by the way they couldn't fill out their flight suits or the patchiness of their thin mustaches.</p>

<p>Edaar leaned in conspiratorially.</p>

<p>“These boys are looking to enter the races. They reckon you’re a good luck charm, even though I tell them you are just <em>el tonto</em>. You’re certainly the luckiest motherfucker in the galaxy, eh? Juare here said earlier he'd kill for a lock of your hair. Any interest in selling?”</p>

<p>Jannis couldn't help but smile as the boys at the table all lit up bright red, one in particular folding into themselves in embarrassment.</p>

<p>“Hmm,” he said, leaning toward the closest boy to his right. “What do <em>you</em> think it's worth?” he asked, reaching up and holding out a small chunk of his locks towards the boy's face.</p>

<p>The boy began to stammer incoherently, and Jannis let his hair fall and patted him on the shoulder.</p>

<p>“I can assure you my hair is worth either <em>nothing</em>, or so much you couldn't afford it until <em>after</em> your first run,” Jannis said. “So no use thinking about it.”</p>

<p>Ignoring Edaar's laugh from his left, he looked across at one of the boys on the far side of the table.</p>

<p>“Aren't you a little young for racing?” he asked, though it wasn't really a question. The boy looked barely fourteen.</p>

<p>“Aye, sir,” the boy responded, “I'm just training now. I've never piloted, see. But I need to race as soon as I'm allowed.”</p>

<p>Jannis had the good sense not to prod. The answer was always depressing. Probably a sister or family in chains.</p>

<p>He didn't <em>approve</em> of Edaar's post-race choice to run a flight school training the next generation of sacrifices… but he had to admit that he'd rather Edaar be teaching them than anyone else. He was just about the best damned pilot Jannis had ever seen in action. And his kids had a habit of surviving a few percentage points more of the time than anyone else.</p>

<p>“So what was it this time,” Edaar asked, breaking his brief reverie. “<em>Fourteen</em> runs? Surely not.”</p>

<p>Jannis rolled his eyes. There was no way to answer this question without earning fawning looks or gasps. He simply shrugged.</p>

<p>“I stopped counting,” he said.</p>

<p>“Ahh, spoken like a true <em>tarado</em>,” Edaar responded, gesticulating at him while looking at his students. “You listen here, my best lesson I can give you is to <em>not be like Jannis</em>,” he concluded. “You live past your race, you go give your <em>madre</em> a kiss and you never fly a space ship again, you hear me?”</p>

<p>Jannis looked away. He hoped they would follow that advice, or better yet, never race, but he knew if he looked he'd see their determination to do the opposite. It was like that with every crop.</p>

<p>“I have to go,” he said. “Auction is starting soon.”</p>

<p>“Ayyyyy, brother,” Edaar moaned, drawing out the sound. “You haven't even had a drink yet. Why you never just watch it here with everyone else?”</p>

<p>Jannis reached out and swiped Edaar's drink, downing it in one painful pull.</p>

<p>“There, now I've had a drink,” he said, forcing down a burp. “I'll watch it here as soon as you prove to me I can focus without you screeching in my ear and distracting me.”</p>

<p>He stood, cuffed the now-pudgy man playfully across the ear, eliciting a mock cry, nodded at the young pilots-in-training, and left the bar.</p>

<hr />

<p>Farudan Station orbited the planet bearing its name, tucked into a quiet, neutral system that sat at the end of a spoke of the Second Galactic Empire in a region considered neutral bordering the Concordia Matczesum.</p>

<p>By all rights, it would be a forgettable system, if not for the auctions. Given the SGE's rather tempestuous relations with its other neighbors, the merchant guild of the Concordia found the right theirs to host the Eneregium auctions, from which they profited by fraction and by prestige.</p>

<p>Still, it was a rather dinky station. The auction itself happened planetside, in the gilded halls of the Matczesum houses, with the majority of atendees delegates from around the galaxy. Travel to and from planetary surfaces was still rather expensive — weaving hadn't solved <em>that</em> problem yet. The gravity problem. Many spacers spent their whole lives off planet, knowing systems by their stations alone.</p>

<p>Jannis walked along the outer corridor of the rotating ring of the station, seeking a quiet place to hide himself. Below him, the floor of hardened clear nanoplastics showed the planetary surface below. He'd heard Farudan had once been green and lush, but that simply meant it had been survivable. The weavers of the SGE had since shaped the planet to their will, glittering cities shining like stars on the planet's surface, structures extending so high into the atmosphere they were visible from the station above.</p>

<p>A quiet corner presented itself in an unused hangar bay. He settled down, pulling his cap back over his head, and waited to see what he'd earned.</p>

<hr />

<p>Jannis stood as the auction began, leaning against a railing looking down over a drydock. Sliding his finger upward along his comm, he sent the live view of the auction boards whooshing up into a holographic frame in front of him. He watched carefully as the numbers ticked by. It had been a good run. He'd brought full cores, and it appeared several others had bugged out after fifty or sixty percent, but still supplied a decent amount.</p>

<p>He knew they'd be gazing at him with hostility if they were anywhere in the room. Their contracts were designed such that screaming out early led to a massive slash to a racer's portion of the sale. The lenders were, after all, supplying them with ships and equipment for each run. No full tank, no full cut.</p>

<p>He'd stayed till the end, as he always had. And had lived, yet again. He knew rumors already abounded about him. <em>Good luck charm</em> was the most benign. Some thought he was an agent of the SGE, with some unheard of means of communicating while on a run. Others thought he was a weaver who could somehow weave while in the overwhelming field inside the exclusion zone. Whatever the theory, it painted him a cheater. He'd faced more than one corridor stabbing attempt on Farudan Station.</p>

<p>His comm dinged, notifying him that his cores were up. His eyes scanned the holoscreen, tracking the bids coming in. He was a little surprised SGE hadn't surreptitiously pilfered his full cores before the auction. They often did, though it didn't matter to him; he still got paid a fair price.</p>

<p>He gave a quick mental thanks to whichever god or physics equation determined that Eneregium couldn't be transferred between containers — once siphoned from a source, it could only be <em>used</em>. His full cores were worth significantly more than the partial ones.</p>

<p>Calculating a quick regression on the bids, he figured he would be earning a veritable fortune on this run. That happened sometimes; whenever a few previous runs had gone poorly and supply was short, or when the galactic credit was in flux. The currency was actually tied to the auction price of Eneregium, though Jannis never claimed to understand how that worked.</p>

<p>As the bell rang on the auction, he tightened his mouth, though whether to a smile or grimace was unclear. He closed the holoscreen, now using the holo-tab itself for more privacy.</p>

<p>As he waited for the credit transfer, he looked again out over the twinkling lights of the rotating station and the glittering planet below. <em>All these pilots, dying, risking death, just so</em> they <em>can weave a monument to their ego across every system in the galaxy.</em></p>

<p>Jannis felt a buzz, and confirmed the amount transferred into his account represented his negotiated cut. Then he tapped a few selections into his comm, and watched as the units drained out of his accounts in a flicker of ones and zeros.</p>

<p>He put his comm in his pocket, and walked back through the station toward his cabin.</p>

<h2 id="kesra">Kesra</h2>

<p>Deep in the Arc'ala Principalities, on a planet with only zero-point-five lawmasters, a girl rolled some dice and took several men for all they were worth. Kesra was good at things like that. <em>That</em> wasn't actually the hard part. The hard part was extraditing oneself from angry smugglers convinced you had cheated them. Which, of course, she had.</p>

<p>On a cold, dusty evening in the spaceport of Tewani, Kesra had just won what she called the <em>bones hand</em>. It was a hand where, while not a big pull in and of itself, had her opponents looking at their stacks and realizing in their bones that they wouldn't be able to buy themselves back into the game.</p>

<p>This was also usually accompanied with an <em>I've been swindled</em> feeling.</p>

<p>So she gathered her chips with a flourish, giving a small curtsy despite not wearing anything approximating a dress, and said,</p>

<p>“Hope to see you around Hellantia!” before darting through the casino and out into the streets. She'd cash her chips the next day, when the smugglers had made their way off-planet.</p>

<p>As she slipped into an alley, she giggled at the confused look on their faces as she left.</p>

<p>She liked to think it was her sparklingly off-kilter personality, but in all likelihood, it was the result of them trying and failing to perform mental geometric math, or not recognizing her far-distant term for the galaxy. The First Galactic Council had done an admirable job carving a common language out of the many species that had been present, but of all words in the lexicon, each planet tended to hang tightly to its ancient term for the galaxy itself.</p>

<p>Slipping between sheetmetal alleys, she made her way toward the hovel her crew was staying in. Not a thieving crew, though she'd rolled with plenty of those. No, a real-god-damned-space-ship crew. And she was a part of it.</p>

<p>The only problem was they didn't have a ship.</p>

<p>Don't have a ship <em>anymore</em>, she thought bitterly, as the image of Skaff Mcrue flashed unpleasantly across her thoughts. But that was going to change soon. Especially now that they had some credits to work with.</p>

<p>They'd been tracking their own goddamned ship for six months now, forced to hitch rides in freighters and refugee transports, wasting valuable coin on informants to uncover where Skaff had absconded to next. Tewani was the closest they'd gotten. Skaff was actually <em>here</em>, supposedly, gambling away some earnings. That meant their ship was here, too, on one of the many launch pads that dotted the exterior of the town. They'd sent Grouch out to try and sniff it out.</p>

<p>Kesra's job had been to monitor the gambling dens, and either look for Skaff or find out how long he'd be off-ship.</p>

<p><em>Which you failed to do,</em> she thought, passing a body hanging limp over the side of a dive's window and very responsibly electing not to investigate its pockets.</p>

<p>It wasn't <em>entirely</em> her fault. Tewani gambling houses were not well-known for letting people enter and just sneak around without <em>actually</em> gambling. She had to sit down, really, to maintain her cover. Might as well earn some credits too.</p>

<p>And she'd gathered some valuable intel. Most of it was about <em>other</em> gangs in the area, but hey, some of those could attack her crew later, and then her crew would be glad she'd been listening. Most importantly, while she hadn't been able to find Skaff amongst the thousand dens of Tewani's Undertowers, she <em>had</em> heard some smugglers laughing that Skaff and his crew were deep into a crawl, and currently too inebriated to move, apparently.</p>

<p>That meant they had a window.</p>

<p>She arrived at the hovel, opening a hatch in the ground and sliding down a small ladder through a hole into an unadorned basement space in which she and the rest of the crew had been sleeping on pallets. The owner above was charging them a dumb and frankly insulting amount of credits to sleep there, claiming it was insurance in case they were smugglers. They <em>were</em> smugglers, but not the type anyone on Tewani had to worry about. Nor did they have anything to smuggle at the moment. Or a ship to smuggle it with.</p>

<p>Darting behind a half-wall, Kesra peeled off the now-sweaty Kamiri she'd been wearing topside, pressing a pad on the forearm to deactivate the heating coils. The suit was a thick, heavy rubber insulating the heating elements, and came with extra weight dispersed throughout to allow species of all kind to to move about Te'ani's surface without bounding recklessly in its low gravity.</p>

<p>Suit off, Kesra hopped lightly on her feet and glided upward, easily touching the ceiling eight or so feet above. Pushing off it, she returned down to the surface and caught herself on a wall handle. She loved low-$g$ planets. If she weren't a hairs-breadth away from getting her ship back, she'd be out on the surface leaping from rooftop to rooftop.</p>

<p>She threw on a loose-fitting shift and tied a belt tight at its waist. To this she attached several small tool loops and kits which affixed with a magnetic snap. Finally, she slid her feet into a pair of weighted boots, which were not as good as a Kamiri at keeping one stable but were a lot more comfortable. The she counted her chips. She never counted during the games.</p>

<p>As she stepped back out into the common space, she heard the hatch clang open, and a figure came floating down, ignoring the ladder and thumping into the packed ground below.</p>

<p>Jericho was the best captain Kesra had ever worked under, which was to say, the first captain who hadn't spaced her for her attitude, tried to steal her cut of a job, or propositioned her in the engine bay.</p>

<p>It might have had something to do with the fact that they were a robot. Or — not a robot, exactly — Kesra corrected herself. Autonoma tended to bristle at the term, which they prescribed to machines which, regardless of how complex their decision trees, were ultimately not sentient.</p>

<p>Jericho <em>was</em> sentient. If anything proved it, it was their capacity to change — for example, the fact that when Kesra first boarded <em>Alacrity</em>, Jericho <em>hated</em> card games (finding them, he claimed, trivial). But six months of Kesra throwing inane, baffling, (sometimes made up) games at them actually brought them around. Now Jericho would proposition her for games of Smuggler.</p>

<p>Kesra gave Jericho a grin, tossing a chip in their direction. Their body was formed of several interlocking metal sections, treaded wheels at their base which could articulate around to handle stairs, six rod-like arms (they kept four stowed at their back most of the time) with various exchangeable implements, and above their “torso,” a “head” that was just a sensory array of cameras and recievers. She knew the head was for her benefit — Jericho had duplicates of all those receivers in their body as well.</p>

<p>As the chip approached, Jericho made no move to catch it, and Kesra watched as instead, a small hole opened in their chest, winking the chip away into their innards.</p>

<p>“Hey! I won those fair and square.”</p>

<p>“This statement has a vanishingly small probability,” Jericho replied, as their body began to make a series of clanking, whirring, and otherwise alarming noises. Another hole opened up elsewhere on their rectangular torso, and the chip came flying back at her through the low-$g$ room.</p>

<p>She caught it — instantly regretting it as she yelped in pain and started shaking out her stinging hand.</p>

<p>“Apologies, Handler Kesra. My process of calibrating human pain tolerance continues. Customarily we find ourselves in situations for which launched projectiles are to be maximally accelerated, as you well know. I have cleaned your chip, by the way,”</p>

<p>She glanced down to see the chip in her hand was gleaming and polished. Had it really been green before? She'd thought it was brown. <em>Sweet.</em> The green ones were worth more.</p>

<p>“Analysis indicates forty-seven foreign substances present in the residue coating the chip; thirty-five of which were standard — oils, dust, skin cells, the like — while ten were illicit in nature… I am not aware of the `street' name for these compounds, and gather you would balk at their chemical designations.”</p>

<p>“Got that right,” Kesra said too quickly, then grinned. “Be careful you don't get high processing those, though.” Jericho emanated a whirring sound that she took to be a scoff.</p>

<p>“While it would be pleasant to continue to polish your winnings, analyze the drug consumption habits of Tewani’s undertowers, and shoot shit, I do believe Grouch has located Alacrity.”</p>

<p>“Holy shit Jericho, why didn’t you lead with that?! Also, it’s shoot-the-shit.”</p>

<p>“Noted, Handler Kesra. I dallied as a slight delay was preferable. Nil and Faya have yet to exfiltrate the central registry, and recovering Alacrity will be an all-hands operation.”</p>

<p>Kesra grinned wolfishly. “Can you imagine, Jericho? We’re so close to finally getting home.”</p>

<p>Jericho paused, cocking his receptors slightly. “I am aware we are nearly a galactic radius away from the my home system within the Princeps Autonoma, but as I’ve often explained, the quibits in my processor remain entangled with those in the Hisr, allowing me to communicate instantly—”</p>

<p>“<em>Alacrity</em>, Jericho,” Kesra broke in. “I meant our ship.”</p>

<p>“Oh.” After a brief moment, Jericho slowly folded all six of his arms away stowing them behind his torso, a sign of respect and gratitude expressed in vulnerability.</p>

<p>“It pleases me that you consider the ship we share a home,” they said. “I did not expect such a thing, when I first set out.”</p>

<p>“Alright, cool it, before I start getting misty eyed over here,” Kesra panned, feeling a twinge of emotion in her throat nonetheless. “You’re a good captain, you treat us well, and your ship is better equipped than half the junk out there.”</p>

<p>“Let’s go get her.”</p>

<h2 id="jannis">Jannis</h2>

<p>Jannis strapped himself into the pilot’s seat of the <em>Khebet</em>, Edaar sliding into the nav-comms and firing station next to him.</p>

<p>“I known you six years now Jannis, not once you ever ask me for no favor. I don’t know whether to be honored or scared shitless for whatever this is.”</p>

<p>“For now, neither, but at some point it might be both,” Jannis grunted. He flicked on the control panels. “Sorry for all the crap cluttering the FCS, I haven’t flown with a second in a long time.”</p>

<p><em>Khebet</em> was a sleek vessel, a high end racer which Jannis had retrofitted with Theseusean effort over the years. Behind the cockpit, a low cabin held two bunks and a tiny kitchenette — so rarely used that the only working component was the coffee dispenser. Jannis hadn’t bought <em>Khebet</em> for comfort. It was the sole object he’d ever purchased with flare race earnings, and he did so because it was fast, and because it had the best cloaking capabilities available outside the SGE navy.</p>

<p>“I cannot believe you've been hiding this beauty from me,” Edaar complained, tapping at his screens reverently. “It's a wonder, even without your mods. And once I get this workspace cleared up—” with a flourish, the targeting systems came online, cleared of the old files and nav-calculations Jannis had carelessly swiped to his unused station—“Shit! This <em>chica</em> is loaded! Who you fighting wars with in this galaxy, brother?”</p>

<p>Jannis didn't quite respond, grunting noncommittally as he powered up the ships engines. “You know how to use those?”</p>

<p>“Yeesss… will I have to?”</p>

<p>Jannis shrugged. “Hopefully not… and you have the crossbow?”</p>

<p>Edaar shook his head, muttering fearfully, but pulled out the small hand crossbow as requested. It had a plastic printed grip, but the shaft was real wood. Arcane sigils lined the sides of the shaft, and from inside the grip, the soft blue glow of an Eneregium pellet could be seen, pulsing in the dim cabin.</p>

<p>“I don’t know why we still call these crossbows,” Edaar mused. “Where’s the crossbar? Where’s the bowstring?”</p>

<p>“They were both there before,” Jannis replied, though he suspected Edaar’s query was largely rhetorical. “At first Eneregium was used to enhance the striking force of traditional bows, but eventually they realized they could accelerate projectiles down the shaft with Eneregium alone.”</p>

<p>“And weaving,” Edaar added.</p>

<p>“And weaving,” Jannis agreed, bitterly.</p>

<p>“I’m liking this favor of yours less and less,” Edaar said.</p>

<p>“<em>Kebet</em> to <em>Farudan</em>, releasing docking clamps, retracting umbilical,” Jannis replied, activating his comms to the station. Edaar laughed as the ship shuddered slightly under their release from the station.</p>

<p>“Roger <em>Kebet</em>, you are cleared to egress station docking space under heading 0700, keep an eye for the tanker at position 004:015:0095 on your way out.”</p>

<p>“I get it,” Edaar laughed. “No backing out now.”</p>

<p>Jannis shot him a small grin, before flicking the comms again. “Understood <em>Farudan</em>, see you next auction. <em>Khebet</em> out.”</p>

<p>He thought he heard a whispered “crazy motherfucker” slip through the comms channel from the control room before the connection went dead.</p>

<p>Smoothly tacking out from the station, he swooped gracefully around the tanker, hulking in the station’s shadow, and brought them out into open space.</p>

<p>“Guess I get to find out where we’re going now?” Edaar wagered.</p>

<p>“Yep,” Jannis said. He pulled up the guidance system, and selected a trail of wayfinders that snaked out deep into the galaxy’s outer reaches.</p>

<p>Edaar whistled.  “Damn, way out there. You got enough E in your core for that?”</p>

<p>Jannis grimaced. Eneregium wasn’t cheap, even for him. But he nodded. “And enough credits in my account to pay the wayfinder tolls,” he replied.</p>

<p>Edaar pinched his fingers, zooming in on their destination system. “I see why you asked for the crossbow.”</p>

<p>“All systems ready?”</p>

<p>Edaar immediately fell into flight ops mode. “Roger <em>capitán</em> — ship is healthy. This is quite a few jumps. Should we go under?”</p>

<p>“Can you handle without?”</p>

<p>“Yes, but I charge you extra.”</p>

<p>Jannis rolled his eyes, then confirmed their path, and pressed the pulsing red button: \texttt{JUMP*.</p>

<hr />

<p>What followed could only be described as hell—for most anyone in the galaxy. Jannis and Edaar, their entire atomic structure, and that of their ship, folded in upon themselves to the nothing more than quarks and spins, before being destroyed and  reconstituted in the backwash of the massive tetrahedral devices that lurked in the shadow of the galaxy's more traditional Energium sources: star forming regions.</p>

<p>They burst, gasping, into each of these locales, before they and their ship once again disintegrated, paying the tolls to the wayfinders before being beamed on to the next, like thoughts across neurons. Life, followed by excruciating death, ten times over. The average pilot would alternatively die, faint, puke, or otherwise evacuate their bowels in the face of this repeated torture.</p>

<p>Jannis and Edaar simply grunted through it. They weren't the only pilots in the galaxy with the training. Smugglers often relied on multi-wayfinder jumps to evade the various authorities spread across star systems. But only a flare racer knew the particular gut wrench of jumping out of the galactic center. No one knew why, but the excessive energy floating about seemed to make the process more… painful, and involved, than usual.</p>

<p>After seven gut wrenching disintegrations, reconstitutions, and further disintegrations, the <em>Khebet</em> finally emerged, in a burst, into orbit around the smuggling den of the planet Semaroid. Without any shame, the two pilots took their moments to heave and gasp, and, if necessary, vomit into waiting vacuum tubes.</p>

<p>“Extra, double,” Edaar wheezed out. “That was probably the longest jump sequence I've ever done.”</p>

<p>“It's really not that bad,” Jannis deadpanned, before involuntarily gagging.</p>

<p>Unlike the rest of the civilized galaxy, Semaroid did not have a resident space station in orbit. They'd have to go planetside. Going planetside was expensive. Edaar did not seem concerened about Jannis's finances, but Jannis glanced guiltily at his wristpad. He could pay the docking fees… but getting <em>Khebet</em> skyward again would require some additional funding. He tried not to think of who he'd have to swindle on this planet to get it.</p>

<p>“I only been to the Outer Reaches once or twice brother,” Edaar warned. “Not sure I know what to expect down there.”</p>

<p>“It's not so different than Farudan,” Jannis said. “Keep your wits about you… and always shoot first, if you have to.”</p>

<p>With that, he calculated a descent orbit that would tear them through Semaroid's atmosphere without skipping off it or burning up. One which, if all went well, would bring them subsonic over a relative desert. That would give him plenty of time to extend <em>Khebet</em>'s conventional wings, bringing them in for a vertical landing on a spacepad in Drala.</p>

<p>Drala was, for all intents and purposes, the last place one would want to park one's ship. But Jannis didn't plan on being planetside for long, and the launch pad provided the opportunity for a quick egress if things went south.</p>

<p>Both pilots gripped their seatrests as <em>Khebet</em> descended through the atmosphere, red, then white-hot flames engulfing the vessel as its heat-shielding panels deflected the worst of the atmosphere's friction. Weaving or no, descending into atmo remained one of the most tense, most dangerous aspect of space travel. More dangerous than launch. It's why many preferred to keep to the stations. But Jannis's treasure lurked on the planet's surface.</p>

<p>After several minutes of shuddering, the red-hot glow outside the windows faded to the dusty orange-blue of the sky. Jannis threw the reverse thrusters into action, fighting their direction of motion, eventually righting them in Semaroid's sky. They began to descend, the autopilot systems targeting an upright landing on one of the launch pads that spread out from the spaceport's edges like spokes on a wheel.</p>

<p>As they descended, the four wings of the craft crept backward from their flight position, extruding landing pads below their tips. With a thud, they touched down, and the engines sputtered and flickered out of use.</p>

<p>Almost immediately, upon connecting to the spaceport's network, Jannis and Edaar's nav-screens were overrun with advertisements for the gambling houses and brothels in the port. Edaar shielded his eyes and turned away in overwrought disgust as several were direct and salacious in their attempts. Jannis simply swiped the ads aside, instead selecting several options from the station menu, transferring the credits necessary to have his ship refueled. He had enough hypergolic fuel to reach orbit once he could activate the scramjet, but he couldn't do <em>that</em> until their launch reached supersonic speeds in the upper atmosphere. Getting off ground required conventional approaches.</p>

<p>In this, Semaroid's spaceport operated like many others — rocket boosters would be attached to his ship, pre-fueled, and ready to launch them to mid-atmo, where they would separate and fall away, and where his scramjets would take over, followed by the hypergolic engines. The boosters would fall under their own parachutes and be recovered by the launch service.</p>

<p>Jannis felt Edaar's gaze on him, as the man drew the crossbow and held it protectively against his own waist.</p>

<p>“Whatever we do here, we gotta stay alive till dockside attaches our boosters,” Edaar said, a warning tone in his voice.</p>

<p>“Don't worry,” Jannis said. “It'll take us a while to get where we're going anyway.”</p>

<p>“That still makes me worry brother. Means it will take us <em>a while</em> to get back when this goes tits up.”</p>

<p>“There's no pleasing you. C'mon, let's go.”</p>

<p>Jannis dropped out of his seat, climbing down a ceiling ladder through his bunk space, and then sliding down a long ladder that ran along the inside top of the ship. Near the base, he spun open a small airlock hatch, stuffing himself next to Edaar as the man closed the hatch behind them. He opened the outer hatch, which was near the base of the ship but still a good thirty feet off the ground given the fins of the ship supporting them.</p>

<p>He looked out over the pads for a moment, before a helpful droid rolled an extendible ladder over to the ship. He and Edaar climbed down. Swiping from his holo-tab, Jannis tipped the droid and insinuated, via a few binary bytes, that more credits would follow if it kept the ladder in place.</p>

<p>“I've been looking for something,” he said to Edaar, as they crossed the landing pad. “I think I'm close. But there's a piece missing from my picture, and someone on this planet has it.”</p>

<p>Edaar groaned. “I'm terrible at extortion Jannis, you know this. I'm a puppy dog.”</p>

<p>“I'll do the talking. You just hold the crossbow,” Jannis responded.</p>
