    <h1>Dragonseye</h1>
    <article><h1 id="prologue">Prologue</h1>

<p>The Morning Zephyr through the air over Khorvaire, clouds slipping by as the small crew tended to the airfoils and elemental ring of fire coursing around the ship. On deck, in a covered and windowed pavilion, the ship’s several passengers lounged at a few small tables, having just completed their noontime meal. It was somewhat odd that the Zephyr carried any passengers; it was registered as a transport vessel to Khorvwares Inc.  after a brief retrofitting in the wake of the Treaty of Thronehold, and had none of the luxuries of the gilded House Lyrandar vessels now revolutionizing travel.</p>

<p>In fact, the contract that Oryn Hass, the captain of the <em>Morning Zephyr</em>, had signed for the cargo in his hold explicitly forbade the onboarding of  passengers. But when the Zephyr had to make an unexpected landing in Starilaskur due to mechanical troubles, Hass couldn’t resist the urge to sneak a few paying passengers onboard to pad his own pockets.</p>

<p>It was an eclectic group, to be sure. Most familiar to Hass were the two shadowy, hooded figures who spoke little and passed him their gold with the appropriate degree of subtlety for anyone hitching a ride in a transport airship. They kept to their quarters for much of the journey, emerging only for meals. Less roguish, but equally reserved, was the half-elven woman who boarded with a small, ever-so-slightly iridescent fox bounding at her feet. As she negotiated passage to Sharn in Hass’s small quarters, he reckoned he had never met someone paying so much gold to get somewhere they clearly, desperately, wished not to go.</p>

<p>More excited about this potential journey was the large, blue Firbolg toting a heavy, intricate shield. She didn’t… strictly speaking have the galfiars Hass would charge, but she was so disarmingly persuasive, with such a comically charming and wholehearted belief in how inexpensive an airship journey could be, that Hass couldn’t say no. Good for a young lass to get out and see the world, he figured, before Sharn beat it out of her. And last, of course, the Warforged. What an odd egg, that one. Hass could hardly parse what the fellow was on about, but was perfectly happy to take his money.</p>

<p>Jab was the Warforged’s name…  and he did indeed carry a spear, though he didn’t seem to have a personality to use it. Instead, he spent his time roaming the ship and, at any opportunity, approaching the other passengers (and the crew) with pamphlets (literature, he called it), about some “Dragonmarked house” of Warforged. Hass didn’t deign himself an expert in the matters of the dragonmarked houses, but he certainly knew that Warforged — a construct-like species invented by House d’Cannith during the Last War, and only just awarded freedom and citizenship two years prior — did not bear the familial dragonmarks that had lifted the houses to their positions as titans of industry and culture.</p>

<p>That did not stop Jab from delightedly showing any and all his “dragonmark,” a crude-looking rune seemingly carved into the wooden panel of his shoulder with a penknife. No one seemed to have the heart to question it, though.</p>

<p>“Do you desire to learn the secrets of heredity and aging concealed from the warforged race? I invite you to join House Geneo! Learn to beget warforged children, and gain the mortality of the fleshy races!” Hass heard the slight robotic lilt drift across the pavilion. He could see the slight frown from the half-elven woman in response as she absentmindedly pet her fox, curled up in her lap. Stepping forward into the pavilion, Hass traced a small sigil in the air to amplify his voice with a minor Thaumaturgy.</p>

<p>“Attention everyone. Our Zil communicator has just made contact with Lyrandar Tower in Sharn and secured our berth there. We should be arriving in a few hours, just around sunset. I highly recommend being on deck at that time — the city at sunset is something to behold.”</p>

<p>As Hass finished the announcement, he noticed that the group of passengers — the woman, Venezia, the Warforged, Jab, the Firbolg, Brim, and the shadowy figure who went by “Snipe” — were not in fact looking at him. They were looking up, through the glass paneling in the roof of the pavilion.</p>

<p>He glanced upward himself, peering into the bright blue of the sky, and, narrowing his eyes, made out the speck of darkness above that seemed to be slowly growing in size. As several moments ticked by, feeling like years, Hass and his passengers watched as the speck resolved into a sleek, gray airship, hundreds of feet above them. 
Hass felt a tremor of fear shoot through him, the tales of air piracy in the Lhazaar Principalities playing at the edge of his consciousness.</p>

<p><em>But we’re so close to Sharn</em>, he thought. <em>It must just be another passing ship.</em> As he convinced himself of this, he heard a slight gasp from Ven, her fox glowing brighter. Focusing again, he noticed that a new set of specks, these ones black, seemed to have separated from the other airship, and were rapidly falling toward the <em>Zephyr</em>.</p>

<p>Slowly stepping back, he looked down at his passengers and tried to control the tremor in his voice.
“Please, uh, please head to your cabins. And lock the doors.”</p>

<p>With that, he turned and ran, cranking out the Thaumaturgy sigil again and booming out: 
“Crew to your stations. We are under attack.” As he continued to run, Hass heard the sound of the ship’s siren begin to ring, started by his pilot. He bounded up the ladder to the aft deck which housed the ships controls, and turned to glance back at the sky.</p>

<p>He turned just in time to watch, transfixed, as several streaks of fiery red light streaked out toward his ship from the rapidly descending specks, now clearly visible as black-clad humanoids. The streaks struck the forward deck of the ship before the figures did, fiery explosions ripping through the hull. All of the glass windows of the pavilion below shattered instantly, as the forward half of the ship went up in flames.</p>
<h1 id="chapter-1">Chapter 1</h1>

<p>Ven ducked down, shielding her face from flying glass and splinters as her fox yelped in surprise. She looked around, disoriented, as the heat of flames out on deck reached her face. Something within her stirred, at the warmth of it.</p>

<p>Across the pavilion, the others seemed to have survived as well, the large blue girl — Brimstone Malleary, Ven recalled her cheerily introducing herself — was holding her sizable shield up in front of her and Jab, the chattering Warforged, seemed to have leaped nimbly behind the table at which they had been eating meals.</p>

<p>She felt a flash of movement to her left, as the shadowy figure who she’d never actually spoken to darted back through the pavilion towards the stairs leading down to the cargo hold without a word. 
She didn’t have time to consider this further as on the flaming deck in front of the now torn-open pavilion, several figures made three point landings. They were clad in all black, but as they looked up, revealing their eyes through gaps in the veils, Ven swore she saw a tinge of red.</p>

<p>Suddenly, the ship lurched violently downward, tilting dangerously toward the ground. Ven looked nervously toward the damaged section of the elemental ring. While she’d left her home and her Lyrandar name behind before airships became common, she’d heard enough about their development to know the ring had to be stable for the ship to move.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, several crew members of the Zephyr had raced in towards the assailants, scimitars and rapiers drawn. As the ship lurched, one was flung into the air. Before Ven could react, she saw the tall, central figure amongst the attackers raise a hand, and seemingly with their mind, carry the airmen’s velocity forward, launching them over the edge of the deck and into the open sky. 
<em>Fuck, Fuck, Fuck!</em></p>

<p>Ven scrambled up, noting the other passengers around her were also jumping into some kind of action. Holding back the searing pangs of panic, she called out to Brim, who’d introduced herself as a blacksmith:</p>

<p>“Brim, the ring! We’ll fall out of the sky if that thing stays broken!”</p>

<p>Brim nodded a terse, frightened response, and began sprinting over toward the side of the ship where the beam out to the elemental ring was located. To her other side, a growl pierced her ears and she turned in time to see one of the quiet passengers, Snipe,  morph — shift — into a beast-like version of themselves, drawing a rapier and leaping forward.</p>

<p>As the flames licked higher and higher, burning away at the hull of the ship, Ven could feel the buoyancy of the soarwood begin to give way, gradually being eaten away by the flames. 
As she stared into the wall of flames, her mind tore back two years, to desperate sprinting through a dark, twisted forest, a wall of flame at her heels, a terrible mist roiling within it. The panic was truly setting in now. She shook her head, violently pushing it aside.</p>

<p>Before her, Snipe and Jab — who now actually wielded the spear that had before served only as a walking staff — had joined the skirmishes on deck, darting in with the ship’s crew to engage the attackers.</p>

<p>Ven was a healer, not a fighter. Seeking something helpful to do, she raced back through the pavilion, toward the stairs leading up to the cockpit of the ship, where the House Lyrandar pilot was likely fighting tooth and nail to keep the bound elemental within the ring, and the ship in the air. She didn’t have the dragonmark of her family, the Mark of Storms, so she couldn’t fly the ship herself. But she was knowledgeable enough about air vehicles. 
She got to the staircase just as two of the black-clad attackers did, coming around the deck from the other side.</p>

<p><em>Dragons below</em>, she thought, screeching to a halt as one of them turned to face her, blocking her path, gesturing the other one forward.</p>

<p>“There weren't supposed to be passengers,” the man growled, eyes piercing down at Ven with a now definitively red glow. “Certainly not ones who’d fight back. But I guess I can take out the little girl for sport.”</p>

<p>Ven felt the rage rising in her chest, something within her heating, literally, as flames began to spring from her palms. 
“I’m 29, you piece of shit!” She reached out, channeling the flaming energy towards him. He attempted to dodge, but not nearly quickly enough. Her fox spat a mote of fire at him for good measure.</p>

<p>“Dolurrh!” The man spun, slapping at his uniform to put out the flames, before turning back to Ven with a snarl. “So you’re fire affine are you? Well so am I.”</p>

<p>Ven scrambled as the man seemed to summon forth his own wellspring of fire from within himself, just dodging his swipe. She heard a scream come from within the cockpit above, as the ship lurched violently again, nearly throwing both her and the attacker off balance.</p>

<p>“I’m sure it still hurts!” she snarled back, slamming into him with another magical surge. Whatever it took, she knew she had to get to that cockpit.</p>

<hr />

<p>Brim peeked nervously out over the edge of the ship. Far below, the thick trees of the King’s forest beckoned, looking deceptively like soft green padding.</p>

<p>She looked out over the beam-like spoke that extended out from the side of the ship. At its end, one of the small channeling rings was damaged, twisted into an unnatural shape by the blasts, and was now passing into the path of the bound fire elemental that surrounded the ship in a ring. The point of contact was sparking and screeching as the elemental passed through the bent metal.</p>

<p>As she neared the railing, the din of the battle behind her seemed to recede under the roar of the wind and fire.</p>

<p>She knew she could fix it — or at least, bend it back into place, she had no idea if it was also magically busted — but to do so she’d have to climb out onto the 25-foot long spoke, with nothing but her grip keeping her from falling to a certain death. This was, Brim thought, not ideal.</p>

<p>It took the ship lurching one more time to spur her to take a deep breath and crawl out onto the beam toward the sparking connection.</p>

<p>The <em>Morning Zephyr</em>, as it turns out, was equipped with several magically enhanced  airfoils mounted around the front of the ship, responsible for redirecting air around the hull. As a result, the top-deck of the ship was generally a pleasant place to stand or stroll, even at full speed; the airflow over it was rarely more than a small breeze.</p>

<p>Not so out on the beam, where the full force of the Brelish sky now pushed against Brim’s rather large form as she scooted, inch by inch, further away from the safety of the ship. Somewhere to her right, a fading scream reached her ear as a blur descended away from the Zephyr. Brim kept her eyes locked on the spoke beneath her.</p>

<p>Hand over hand, her eyes tracing the grain of the wood and pulsing magic of the nexus channels, she made her way out the 25 or so feet between the hull and the elemental ring.</p>

<p>As she neared, she felt the intense heat of the fire elemental streaking past before her. It was, if anything, a comforting feeling. She had grown up in her family’s forge, and was an accomplished blacksmith herself. Fire she could handle. Heights were another thing.</p>

<p>She felt her hammer at her side; it had been bumping comfortingly against her thigh with each crawl out on the spoke. But as she arrived at the point of contact with the ring, she realized she wouldn’t be able to swing her arm without throwing herself wildly off balance.</p>

<p><em>Onatar help me</em>, she thought, reaching within herself to the small wellspring of magic that she had only ever used before to aid her enchantment of goods in a workshop. Thankfully, the magic came, and reaching out one hand, she released a simple mending cantrip, hoping it would be enough.</p>

<p>For a moment it appeared it wouldn’t, the spell being underpowered to bend the sturdy, now-akimbo metal. But with a second coaxing attempt — aided by the fact that the metal, as a result of it now intersecting the ring of fire, was growing hot — the ring slowly shuddered back into place, leaving the path of the swirling fire elemental free.</p>

<p>Brim sighed in relief, before immediately facing what now seemed like the most stressful part of all: getting back.</p>

<p>“Do I turn around or just back up?” she muttered, entirely unequipped to ascertain which was the more dangerous maneuver. In the end, she decided that she’d rather not back straight into the spear of one of the assailants on deck, and attempted a 180-degree rotation.</p>

<p>She turned just in time to see a chunk of some wood liberated from the pavilion in the explosions smashing in her direction, seemingly at the mental behest of one of the cloaked figures on deck. She ducked, but the motion threw one of her legs over the edge of the beam, and she nearly slipped off entirely.</p>

<p><em>Khyber!</em> she thought, immediately cringing at the disapproving gaze her parents would throw her for swearing. Reestablishing her grip, she lay low, hugging the beam with both arms and legs, waiting for any further projectiles.</p>

<p>After several tense, windswept moments — not helped by her vision occasionally being blocked by her own hair whipping in the breeze — she saw the figure turn, distracted by the rapier that had appeared seemingly from nowhere but was now in the immediate vicinity of their throat.</p>

<p>Murmuring a thanks to Onatar, she slowly shuffled her way back toward the deck.</p>

<p>*Is this really what the real world is like? * Her quiet home in the woods seemed already so very distant… but the fear and adrenaline of the attack mixed, ever so subtly, with the excitement and discovery of it all as well.</p>

<hr />

<p>Snipe leaped rapier-first into the fray with a feral pleasure, feeling the strength of his shifted form infusing his muscles. This was not by any means his first fight… though it was the first to take place on an airship, and one falling from the sky, and one that was on fire.</p>

<p>First time for everything, he thought. If he lived, it would certainly be a story for the riff raff of bottom-feeding adventurers at Deathsgate, the adventuring guild currently paying his way. Worth a few free  rounds of ale at least, he was sure of it.</p>

<p>Snipe wasn’t unduly concerned about the attackers; he’d seen plenty of black-clad, scurrilous folk in his time, and usually, the intimidating getup was more of a coping mechanism than any real tactical advantage. Tactical advantage was his territory.</p>

<p>Swirling fluidly through the sets of fighting crew and assailant, he picked his moments, waiting until an enemy levied their full attention on a strike before darting in himself and skewering them with his rapier. Quickly disengaging before they could respond, he’d flow to the next target, alternating stabs of his sword with bites from his now extra-long, beast-like teeth.</p>

<p>For a while, it seemed these attackers would go down like most he fought: before he did. But trepidation slowly creeped into his mind as he realized that these people knew what they were doing, and one by one, the crew of the Zephyr were succumbing around him. Soon, it was going to be all of them against him.</p>

<p>Something else was bothering him as well. Snipe was not inexperienced at reading people in combat. While several of the assailants had immediately fucked off to the other part of the ship, those here at the front fought without… purpose? He couldn’t put his finger on it, but he started to suspect this particular fight was nothing but a distraction.</p>

<p>Before he had time to examine this further, a stiff breeze knocked him — and near everyone else on the foredeck — clean off his feet. One crew member was lifted off and flew back through the broken pavilion. Snipe didn’t hear the thump of their landing, if there was one.</p>

<p>Taking advantage of the claws that were temporarily at his disposal, he dug into the burning deck and looked to the source of the wind, which wasn’t hard to find. The primary airfoil at the nose of the Zephyr was currently in flames and lilting to the side. Whether the flames were inhibiting the enchantment, or the angle was to blame, fast flowing air was now streaking across the deck.</p>

<p>Snipe crawled forward against the wind, feeling his stomach turn as the misdirected air seemed to be pushing the nose of the ship steeply down toward the ground. Reaching over his shoulder, he ripped his own cloak off — he’d been in enough tomb traps to have come by a fireproof one — and leapt the final few feet forward, simultaneously smothering the airfoil and also attempting to jam it back up in the position he remembered it being.</p>

<p>To his cloak’s credit, the fire was quickly extinguished. He hadn’t been entirely sure it was a genuine article, but made a mental note to find the dealer Erasus in Sharn and toss him a few extra sovereigns.</p>

<p>Less fortunately, the airfoil didn’t appear to budge, his strength not enough to fight the new pressure of the air going over it. 
“Need some help?” he heard from next to him, and turned to see Jab standing beside him. “I’m pretty heavy, so the wind’s not a big issue,” he offered, helpfully.</p>

<p>Snipe nodded, and together, they jammed their shoulders into the airfoil, heaving it back into place.</p>

<p>The air immediately calmed, and the nose of the ship bobbed upward, equilibrating at a roughly horizontal attitude. Snipe could still feel in the pit of his stomach that the ship was losing altitude, and realized that the buoyancy in the air was coming from the wood of the hull itself, which was now on fire.</p>

<p>“We need to put out some of these flames,” he called to Jab, “Not much more of this wood can burn or we’re fucked.”</p>

<p>Jab nodded, and with a remarkably thoughtful expression for a creature with no moving parts on their face, grabbed Snipe’s cloak, wrapped it around himself, and proceeded to fall over, rolling over the flaming deck. Snipe watched incredulously as large swaths of the flame peppering the deck winked out.</p>

<hr />

<p>Well this is fun! So thought the warforged as he rolled around on the deck wrapped in a scratchy, but surprisingly extinguishing cloak. He wasn’t very happy about the fact that these assailants seemed intent on knocking their ship out of the sky… but at the same time, he was sort of excited to have some new people to practice his House Digenio speech on. The other passengers on the trip had seemed pretty closed off to the idea of joining, but he knew he just needed a bit more practice honing the pitch.</p>

<p>As he rolled, merrily lost in thought, he cow tipped no fewer than 4 individuals — crew and assailant alike — who heard a congenial “Ooops!” as the rolling cylinder continued on its way.</p>

<p>Soon, the majority of the flames licking at the forward deck of the ship were extinguished. Jab could feel within his attitude-sensor — three small orthogonal vials of viscous liquid near the center of his chest — that the ship was no longer descending rapidly. They might need to drop some weight, but so long as no more of the wood burned, they would probably stay airborne.</p>

<p>Untangling himself from the cloak, he stood up to give a thumbs up to Snipe, just in time to watch him, and one of the black-clad attackers, go over the starboard railing of the deck. 
Well that’s not good! He ran over to the edge, not exactly sure what he would do about it, but hummed in relief as he saw both figures still technically aboard, albeit just barely hanging on to one of the large lower fins that ran along the bottom of the hull. 
It seemed reasonably stable down there: the fin wasn’t quite flat — it was angled at roughly 30 degrees downward — but if not for the wind would be perfectly standable.</p>

<p>Still, his new friend Snipe looked like he was struggling a bit to hang on. Jab’s processors quickly carried out a projectile motion calculation — first estimating the distance down, then incorporating the forward velocity and acceleration of the ship, then his own weight and any applicable air drag, and finally, in a brilliant touch, internally modifying the gravitational constant to account for the fact that in and around Sharn, the Syrania Manifest Zone lowered the force of gravity — and, satisfied with the converged solution, Jab leaped out over the edge of the ship.</p>

<p>Jab was blissfully unaware of almost all of this. Eyeing a spot next to where Snipe and his assailant landed, he jumped, enjoyed the feeling of weightlessness, and landed lightly on the fin. At least, as lightly as a 300 stone mechanical being could land. Stabbing may have been Snipe’s forte, but acrobatic maneuvers were certainly his.</p>

<p>As he landed, he turned toward Snipe, who’d already tussled the black-clad figure to the ground and given him a solid shove toward the edge of the fin. The figure tumbled end over end, desperately scrambling for any purchase, but the fin was constructed to be as smooth as aerodynamically possible. Robes half tearing off, they just managed to cling to the edge of the fin before being tossed into the sky.</p>

<p>Jab watched Snipe, claws securing him to the fin, stalk over toward the figure, and deemed the situation under control. Instead, he turned his attention to the back of the fin, where several flaps were tilted up at various angles, another mechanism for controlling the ship. They were also on fire. Holding out the cloak, he bounded over to the fins and began smothering those flames as well.</p>

<p>As the flames subsided, Jab turned to make his way, somehow, back on deck, and noticed Snipe (seemingly having disposed of the intruder) was pressed up against a window in the hull. Joining alongside, he pressed his face to the neighboring window to see what the fuss was about.</p>

<p>He could see the telltale bright streaks of offensive magic being cast before his forehead thumped the glass.</p>
<h1 id="chapter-2">Chapter 2</h1>

<p>Ven surveyed the scene within the cockpit with dismay. The small room, which had a large, forward tilted and tinted window which extended fully around the chamber — affording 360 degree views of the ship and surrounding sky — was suffused with the oxidized, metallic scent of blood.</p>

<p>Crumpled in a motionless heap in the back corner of the room was Captain Hass, a vicious looking black necrotic wound still slowly eating its way through his body.</p>

<p>Left alive, barely, was the pilot, who was currently on his knees, blood pouring from a gash in his forehead, barely hanging with one hand to the console from which the pilot’s control emanated. His other hand reached, shaking, upward, tracing the slight somatic elements to the command of the control rod.</p>

<p>It was a fascinating device. A single metal rod protruding from a wooden box, the pilot exerted their will on the bound elemental by channeling commands through this antenna.</p>

<p>Ven could tell that the pilot was doing everything in their power just to hold the entire system steady. Cursing her lack of a medical kit — it was in her chambers, too far now — she ripped some cloth from her tunic and attempted to staunch the worst of his wounds. She could feel him trembling in her hands.</p>

<p>She felt a shudder from below, and in that moment, noticed the trap-door in the back corner of the room. The captain had half fallen over it, clearly attempting to defend it from the masked combatant.</p>

<p>There was nothing much more she could do for the pilot, who, she knew in the heart of her medic’s intuition, was likely going to die. Tying off the cloth bandage, Ven moved to the trap door. 
She stared at it for a few moments, knowing that whatever lay below was probably about to kill her, too.</p>

<p>As another second ticked by, Ven felt a white-hot nudge from behind, and looked back to see her small fox, now quite fully aflame, looking at her expectantly.</p>

<p>Taking a deep breath to steel herself, she threw open the trapdoor and began climbing down the ladder to the cargo hold.</p>

<p>Ven dropped down behind a set of nondescript looking crates, and immediately felt the sparkling thud of a spell impacting the wood above her head. She ducked down, and crawling forward, peeked around the side of the crate in front of her.</p>

<p>The rest of the cargo hold, extending to the front of the bow, was remarkably empty. The captain — she winced — was evidently not a great businessman when it came to filling his hold.</p>

<p>Standing at the very front of the hold, in the corner formed by the two hull halves joining, was the fifth passenger on their journey. The one who’d never even given the rest of them a name.</p>

<p>Clutched to his chest in one arm was a small barrel, only around a foot in diameter. His other hand was up in front of him, tracing some type of magic.</p>

<p>Penning him into the corner were three of the intruding attackers, including the one she’d fought on deck, who’d ended their interaction by knocking her out for a few seconds and disappearing. A forth assailant was off to the side, seemingly concerned only with pumping spell after spell into the forge-like arcane engine that powered the ship’s nexus.</p>

<p><em>Sovereigns, they’re trying to destroy the ship, too,</em> she thought. 
 Ven watched as one of the others launched another offensive spell at the figure, where it ricocheted off of some sort of abjurative shield and impacted the roof above them.</p>

<p>“Enough of these games, we need the dragonseye, now,” growled the largest of the three, seemingly the leader. “Aja, please.” 
The third individual, who thus far had not acted, didn’t respond, besides raising a hand and flicking it to the side.</p>

<p>In an instant, whatever shields the individual had shattered, and he went flying sideways into the wall of the hull, stumbling away dazed but still gripping the barrel in a death grip.</p>

<p>Ven had no idea what was in that barrel, no knowledge of who this individual was. But she heard a small voice, an intuition, in her head, that spoke in flickering, flaming tones. And she knew, without a doubt, that once these people got whatever was in that barrel, they were going to leave, and make sure no one on this ship survived.</p>

<p>Hoping the three were all distracted by their quarry, she stepped out from behind the crate, readied herself, and reached for the magic.</p>

<hr />

<p>“We gotta help her!” Brim heard the words, barely, coming over the edge of the deck of the ship before they were snatched by the wind. She had finished repairing the elemental ring and re-emerged on deck to discover that, save for unconscious or dead bodies, the forward deck was now deserted.</p>

<p>Running over to the edge, she looked over the edge to see Snipe and Jab looking in the windows of the cargo hold. 
“What’s happening?” Brim called down to the two on the fin, and looking up, Jab called back,</p>

<p>“There’s something bad going down in the cargo hold! Ven looks like she’s in trouble!”</p>

<p>Brim turned and sprinted her way into the wreckage of the pavilion, searching for the staircase leading down into the hold.</p>

<p>She found it quickly; it appeared someone else had gone through before her and cleared the way. Stooping under the low ceiling, Brim squeezed her frame down the narrow, steep stairs and into the cargo hold.</p>

<p>Several things then happened very rapidly. Ven, standing to one side of the hold, had a hand outstretched toward the menacing group at the front end of the hold. She loosed a column of fire in their direction, which blasted across the small chamber and sent them sprawling to dodge it.</p>

<p>At nearly the same moment, there was a sound of shattering glass, and looking over, Brim saw the butt of Jab’s spear retreat through a now broken window, to be replaced by his head as he scrambled through, dropping down into the room near Ven.</p>

<p>As this was going on, the dazed passenger, still gripping the small barrel to their side, was attempting to sprint through the temporarily distracted attackers. Brim found herself wondering whether this additional mysterious passenger was also bad news.</p>

<p>As Snipe tumbled, less gracefully than Jab, through the open window, Brim reached for the holy symbol she wore around her neck and squeezed. It was warm to the touch already, though whether from her deity’s presence or the flames she’d been wading through she didn’t know.</p>

<p>As one hand traced a sigil in the air, she mouthed a short incantation — a forge blessing, often used before a session in the workshop. It was a minor spell, but one that had saved her hammering a finger numerous times in the forge back home.</p>

<p>She reached out, and felt the blessing extend out to her three new… companions? They felt, suddenly, indeminiably, like a group, though perhaps one only joined by the acute purpose of not dying.</p>

<p>The next few moments flew by in a blur. Spells of various kind ricocheted through the darkened hold, temporarily flaring with light. The telekinetic assailant tossed several of the crates at them; he even once tried to fling Brim, but her collective heft, plus that of the layers of forge-hardened clothing and her shield kept her firmly in place.</p>

<p>To her own ends, Brim immediately realized that the forth assailant in the room — the one focused on the arcane engine — was doing major damage to the ship. It only took a few strikes of her hammer to take them out of commission.
T
here was a brief stalemate, or at least an equilibrium, established. With five of them (counting the mysterious passenger protecting their prize, whatever it was) against three,  the assailants, despite being clearly more powerful, couldn’t advance on the fifth passenger without taking a barrage of damage from behind.</p>

<p>“This is taking too long,” growled the big, burly one in charge, and, grabbing the smaller of his companions, held them aloft like a human shield against Brim’s sacred flames and made a dash for the fifth passenger.</p>

<p>Brim stepped forward, attempting to close the gap, but before she took a second step she saw a forcefield of magic begin to encircle and surround the boss, minion, and fifth passenger. With a wink, the field collapsed in on them and they were gone.</p>

<p>“Short range teleport!” Brim heard Ven call out, as she flung another spell at the final, abandoned enemy. The figure, while still fighting, had clearly been worn down.</p>

<p>Ven continued, “They must be somewhere on the ship —take this!”
Brim turned just in time to see a small, flaming fox being tossed in her direction. Instructions unclear, she caught the creature, which despite its flaming nature didn’t seem to hurt her, and saw Ven pointing over at Jab. Brim stepped to the side to come up next to the Warforged, and with a small yip, the fox emitted a burst of fiery energy and Brim felt herself being sucked into the void.</p>

<p>Brim blinked, and found herself on the top deck of the ship, immediately above where she had been standing, Jab next to her, and the little fox still in her arms. Brim moved to place the critter on the deck but it jumped lightly from her arms before she could. She noticed the fox didn’t actually stand on the ground, but hovered several inches up.</p>

<p>“Aren’t you a funny one,” she said, and then turned to look around the deck.</p>

<p>It wasn’t a pretty sight. Bodies, primarily of the crew, but also of several assailants, were strewn around the forward deck. The main pavilion, in which they had been relaxing before this all started, looked like it had been bombed. (Well, Brim supposed, it sort of had been).</p>

<p>She saw no sign of the attackers who’d teleported seconds before them, but saw jab pointing up and back, toward the raised pilot’s chambers. Standing on the roof of that chamber, peering up toward their own grey ship, still tracking them several hundred feet up, were the two black-clad attackers. There was no sign of the fifth passenger, and Brim swallowed, knowing there was really only one place they could’ve gone. She heard a voice next to her. 
“Should we… just let them take it? It looks like they’d leave us alone,” Jab mused.</p>

<p>Brim surveyed the damage around them again. 
“No. When they arrived, they were already targeting the critical components of this ship. I think they’re going to blast us straight out of the sky as soon as they’ve escaped.”</p>

<p>Jab nodded in agreement, and began leaping through the wreckage to try to get to the attackers.</p>

<p>Brim knew he’d never make it in time. The main figure was already beginning to trace out the sigils of another short range teleportation, and the ship above had now tacked to approach them. 
They only had a few seconds.</p>

<p>Eyeing the distance, Brim gripped her symbol tightly and called forth a flame of Onatar, sending it streaking toward the two figures standing in the wind. She hoped, prayed, that by forcing them to dodge, she could throw them off balance.</p>

<p>The smaller of the two — she’d named him human shield, though she had no idea of his race — threw themselves successfully out of the way, disappearing from view over the edge of the roof. The other one also saw the blast streaking towards him. He moved to dodge, and Brim watched as he mostly evaded the flames… And tripped.</p>

<p>As if in slow motion, the small barrel left his hands, soaring across the space between them in an arc. It landed somewhere in the ruined pavilion.</p>

<p>Brim could hear the sound of wood cracking, and stepped forward, spotting the barrel, now splayed open, displaying its mysterious interior contents.</p>

<p>She had, by all accounts, no idea what she was looking at. It was a sphere constructed of metal strips, finely crafted, all interlocking and spinning like elements of an orrery. She could see some type of crystal embedded in the thing at various turns.</p>

<p>She had only a moment to dwell on it. The breaking of the housing seemingly activating something about the device, it had begun to spin up even faster, and a red, viscous energy was emanating from within it, flowing around it like a blanket.</p>

<p>Then it exploded.</p>

<p>Red energy blasted from the object, seemingly ignoring the material components of the ship. But it didn’t ignore Brim, who felt a blinding pain, like her whole body had fallen into the forge. Her vision swam red, and then she slipped, almost gratefully, into unconsciousness. The last thing she heard was the sound of Jab thunking to the deck next to her.</p>
<h1 id="chapter-3">Chapter 3</h1>

<p>In the now empty and mostly destroyed cargo hold of the <em>Morning Zephyr</em>, Snipe awoke with a groan. He and Ven had just cornered the last remaining attacker when his vision flashed red and in a blinding, encompassing pain, he’d been knocked unconscious.</p>

<p>His whole body felt weak and trembled slightly — he was no longer shifted, and whatever had happened to him seemed to have drained what little energy he had left.</p>

<p>Blinking around, he saw that both Ven and the assailant were both still down. He stepped over to the assailant and placed two fingers at their neck, expertly seeking out a pulse. He found none.</p>

<p>It was at this point that he felt the searing pain again, red tinting over his eyes. But rather than suffusing his entire body, the pain was now isolated, locking into a spot on his calf. It felt like he was being branded — a fate he’d just barely avoided once on a mission to “recover” a valuable sword from one of the most prolific blacksmiths in Sharn — but he could tell the pain was radiating not from the surface of his skin inward, but rather from deep within his muscles outward. As if something were trying to escape.</p>

<p>Snipe dropped to one knee as the pain left him woozy. He wanted to grab at his calf, but was afraid of what he’d feel when he did.</p>

<p><em>What the fuck happened to me?</em> His mind scrambled for purchase, trying to piece together anything from the chaos of the fight, but found nothing.</p>

<p>And then the pain was gone. Like two gears out of sync that were sparking and grinding against each other, something slipped into place and it’s like the pain had never been there.</p>

<p>Instead, deep in his chest, connecting down through his spine to his calf, he felt a thrum of power. Of magic.</p>

<p>Gingerly peeling up the legs of his pants, he steeled himself for whatever he was going to see.</p>

<p><em>A tattoo?</em> he thought, as his eyes took in the twisting, slightly undulating mark in his skin.* No, that’s not right.* It wasn’t ink, he was sure of it. In fact, if he didn’t know better, he’d say it looked almost like a dragonmark.</p>

<p>Snipe was no expert in magic, or dragonmarks for that matter. He knew they appeared on some people, mostly genetically, and that there were thirteen houses — extended families — which bore a set of well understood dragonmarks. Those houses had over the centuries used the advantages those marks granted to craft economic dynasties. They were, many argued, more powerful in the politics of Khorvaire than the rulers of the five nations.</p>

<p>Though he hadn’t seen every dragonmark — running into marked individuals wasn’t hugely common in his line of work — he knew that they formed some type of arcane sigil. They certainly didn’t look like this.</p>

<p>The mark on Snipe’s calf had some of the intricacies of the arcane marks he’d seen on the forearms of, say, a House Jorasco healer or a House Ghallanda inn-keeper. But his were jagged, rough, more stabbing through each other than flowing around. And there was the red. The few dragonmarks he’d seen were a gentle bluish purple, looking much like a tattoo albeit maybe glowing slightly. His mark was a deep black with tendrils of glowing red tracing through each element of the mark.</p>

<p>Snipe stood up and stretched, trepidatiously waiting for another wave of pain… but it never came. A slow, dangerous thought creeped into the back of his mind, one he realized he’d been pushing down for the last several minutes.</p>

<p>On a hunch, Snipe stepped back over to the body of the assailant on the ground. Peeling away the layers of cut, burned, and blood-soaked robes, his eyes scanned the half-elf’s skin. 
It didn’t take him long to find the black and red mark that mirrored his own.</p>

<hr />

<p>Ven came to with a start, a nightmare playing at the edges of her vision. Mist, fire, smoke in her lungs as she screamed, the strong hand pulling her through, her feet stumbling continuously.</p>

<p>She groaned. <em>No ascension ceremony is worth this</em>, she thought, before remembering the message she’d received from her mother in Sharn had been laced with veiled threats.</p>

<p><em>Everything she says is a veiled threat,</em> Ven thought bitterly. Solia Selavir d’Lyrandar was a pragmatic, hard woman, and she ran the House’s Sharn Enclave with a steel hand. To her credit, she’d taken what was considered in House Lyrandar to be a position best granted as punishment — stations in the House’s headquarters in Stormhome, Fairhaven in Aundair, or Tar Valestas in Valenar were all to be preferred over Sharn — and turned it into one of the House’s most profitable enclaves.</p>

<p>Lyrandars may turn their heads up at the less refined tenor of Breland, but Sharn was the biggest economic hub on the continent, and from this position, Solia had negotiated high-powered contracts with House Cannith and House Sivith, as well as the Aeranal elves (whose island was the only known source of the soarwood now being used to power Lyrandar airships).</p>

<p>Ven had no interest in any of that — her younger sister, Mariel, was clearly going to inherit those responsibilities. She’d expressed her dragonmark at age 10 with no prompting, as a teenage Ven looked on in confusion and jealousy.</p>

<p>Solia left Ven to her own devices after that — any energy she had left after a day of powerbrokering deals for her house was spent developing Mariel’s skills. On the night Ven packed her bags and left Lyrandar tower for what she thought would be the last time, she could see the glow from under her mother’s office door and the quiet sounds of her coaching Mariel in the channeling of the Mark of Storms.</p>

<p>It had been a decade since that night. Ven, now nearly 30, had heard nothing from her family in Sharn as she travelled the continent. They’d probably forgotten her, she figured, their discussions of Lyrandar’s economic growth far more important than Ven’s aptitudes as a common healer.</p>

<p>So when, a little over a week ago, Ven received a letter from Solia at the refugee camp just outside New Cyre where Ven was living and working, she was, to say the least, shocked. 
The letter, in her mother’s instantly recognizable, impeccable penmanship, indicated that Mariel would be soon undergoing the Trial of Siberys to, hopefully (almost certainly) exalt her dragonmark into its most powerful form.</p>

<p>Ven shook her head. Of course Mariel couldn’t stop with just a dragonmark. She has to have a Siberys one.</p>

<p>Ven knew that the Trial of Siberys was dangerous — most who attempted it died — but she had no doubt her sister would, with flying grace, manifest herself into the elite group of a dozen or so individuals on the continent with unrivaled magical affinity.</p>

<p>The letter continued to explain that such an event required all members of the Selavir family to be present. The House matron, Esravash d’Lyrandar, would be personally flying from Stormhome to witness the test, along with most of the House’s upper members.</p>

<p><em>Well, I’m not a Selavir anymore</em>, Ven thought. <em>It’s Ostler now</em>. But she knew it wouldn’t matter. As she read on, she learned, to her surprise, that Solia evidently knew she was here the last two years — since the Mourning — and had been furnishing supplies for the refugee camp without anyone realizing.</p>

<p><em>And there’s the threat</em>, Ven realized. <em>Come to Sharn, or I cut off the supplies and your poor refugees will suffer</em>. Ven couldn’t even comprehend how someone could use the lives of others as some sort of… collateral, but she knew that sort of thing was probably just in her mother’s daily arsenal of getting things done.</p>

<p>She briefly considered whether her mother was bluffing, but soon discarded the thought. Solia never made threats she wouldn't carry out. <em>She probably allocated the supplies just to make sure she’d have leverage on me if she ever needed it,</em> she thought bitterly.</p>

<p>The one confusing aspect of the whole thing was the explanation. <em>She needs me to watch a ceremony for my sister?</em> Ven knew House Lyrandar had some ridiculously anachronsitic traditions, but also knew that Solia probably wouldn’t have shown her cards over something that simple.</p>

<p><em>There’s something else at play here,</em> Ven thought. <em>I’m sure of it.</em></p>

<p>Ven saw Snipe notice her wake up, and clocked, but didn’t comment on, the fact that he quickly rolled down the leg of his pant when she looked over at him.</p>

<p>“You certainly know how to fight,” she said, rolling carefully into a sitting position, the bruises already forming under scrapes and light burns.</p>

<p>“I know how to keep myself alive,” Snipe shrugged. “You didn’t seem so helpless yourself.”</p>

<p>Ven swallowed. <em>He’s not wrong,</em> she thought guiltily. <em>For a healer, I just threw a lot of fire at a lot of people.</em></p>

<p>“I’m going to go topside and see if there’s any crew still alive,” she said. “I should be able to patch them up.”</p>

<p>As she went to take a step toward the staircase out of the cargo hold, she too saw the ribbon of red haze flash before her eyes, a searing pain localizing within her body.</p>

<p><em>Not again,</em> she thought, eyes widening in pain. The… thing, whatever it was, seemed to be searching for purchase somewhere in her body. She felt, somehow, the nature of the magic, as it sparked and chafed against her own mysterious powers she’d recently acquired.</p>

<p><em>No!</em> She shouted, silently into her own body.* I DON’T WANT IT!* 
With all her might, and considerable force of character, she tried to fight the thing, to push it out of her entirely. It felt wrong. Alien. Powerful.</p>

<p>The struggle took her nearly to the edge of unconsciousness again before she felt the pain, which had now been pushed all the way to her left shoulder blade, subside.</p>

<p>A tear rolled down her cheek, then another. She didn’t have to look to know that something was there now, on her back. She could feel it, the power, humming within her. She wiped the tears, and decided to pretend nothing had happened. At least for now.</p>

<hr />

<p>Jab looked at his leg with wonder. Dancing along the front of his quad — which was a beautiful, curving,  polished piece cherry wood inlaid into two metal strips — was a black and red mark that seemed to glow lightly. It was a dragonmark, he was sure of it!</p>

<p>He looked to his other dragonmark, the one on his shoulder, and wondered if he was the first person to ever have two dragonmarks at once.</p>

<p>During the chaos of the fight, he’d lost his robes (or they’d burned away), but he was so excited about his new mark that he forgoed searching for them. He’d never really understood the point of clothing anyway.</p>

<p>Instead, he assessed his surroundings. Looking up, he saw no sign of the sleek, gray airship that had brought the attackers. He also saw no sign of the final assailant — the one who’d dodged Brim’s attack — nor was there any sign of the so-called dragonseye device.</p>

<p><em>Guess they left</em>, he thought.* Good riddance!* They weren’t nice at all.</p>

<p>Looking around the deck, he saw Brimstone, still unconscious, but definitely breathing. He also saw the last, black-clad figure: the leader of the crew of attackers. He was lying face down on the deck, clearly having fallen from the roof of the cockpit after he tripped.</p>

<p>Speaking of the cockpit, Jab hopped over to the railing and looked overboard. The ship was no longer moving forward — the fire elemental was humming, seemingly content, in the ring around the ship, but nothing was driving them forward. More worryingly, Jab could see they were still sinking. The treetops of the King’s forest below were much closer than he remembered from during the fight, and his internal sensors were registering a steady downward motion.</p>

<p>Jab walked toward the pavilion, making his way toward the unconscious attacker.</p>

<p>Peering closely, it appeared the person was alive.</p>

<p><em>I should probably tie him up</em>, Jab thought. T<em>hat’s what they always do with bad guys in stories.</em></p>

<p>He hunted around for a few moments before finding a section of rope, and then, despite having no real knowledge of how to tie someone up, tried his best to restrain the figure’s movement.</p>

<p>That accomplished, he climbed over to the staircase leading to the cockpit and scaled it up, two steps at a time. Entering the small chamber, he immediately noticed the issue that was driving the ship’s lack of motion and slow descent: the pilot was unconscious, crumpled on the floor beneath the controls.</p>

<p><em>I should get Ven</em>, he thought. <em>She said she was a healer.</em></p>

<p>Returning back down to the deck, he saw that Brim was finally stirring.</p>

<hr />

<p>Brim found herself standing before a massive anvil. To her side, a small table contained a familiar set of tools. Behind her, the roar of flames; she knew without looking it was a forge. 
The space itself was huge, a rocky cavern with a domed ceiling a hundred or more feet up. Brim, despite her 7 foot height, felt dwarfed by everything in this chamber. It was like it was a forge for the gods.</p>

<p>Standing around 30 feet away, on the other side of the anvil, Brim saw her family: her Mother, Obsidian, and her younger brothers, Scoria and Basalt. Shane, her older brother, was not with them. 
She tried to call out to them, but Brim quickly realized this thirty foot gap was more of a gulf. Something was keeping them far away, and Brim knew they wouldn’t be able to help her with her task.</p>

<p>Which was… what, exactly? Brim felt the comfort of the tools around her, of the plates of metal ready to be worked, but she didn’t know what she was supposed to make.</p>

<p>“The work will make itself known.”</p>

<p>Brim heard the whisper, calming, and ancient. She picked up a hammer, moved one of the pieces of half worked metal into the flames of the forge, and set to work.</p>

<p>Time passed, hours, maybe days. The nature of the work never clarified itself to her… but as she began, she realized she knew, almost like a brief future projection, where to strike next. But her strength was waning.</p>

<p>“I’m sorry,” she called, “I don’t think I’ll be able to finish it.” She felt herself panicking slightly, frustrated as more of her strikes went awry as her hammering arm grew weaker.</p>

<p>Brim wasn’t sure how much more time had passed, but she finally felt herself giving way. The hammer slipped from her grip, cracking a small chip from the stone floor before. She clung to the edge of the anvil to keep herself standing, staring down at it in shame.</p>

<p><em>I just wanted to help my family,</em> she thought.</p>

<p>Brim felt something in front of her. A presence. She looked up. Standing before her, just barely spectral, was a kindly looking dwarf. He was wearing his own blacksmithing garb, a well-stained and charred apron, tools hanging from a belt wrapped around the center.</p>

<p>He examined the pieces laid out.</p>

<p>“You should be proud of this work, Brimstone,” he rumbled, and despite his small stature, the words rumbled and boomed around the chamber, vibrating in her core. “Many would have given up far before this.”</p>

<p>Taking one of the last components she had worked on, she felt a wellspring of pride and gratitude, mixed with a sprinkling of embarrassment as the final piece was the sorriest of her attempts, made just before her strength left her entirely.</p>

<p>“You are stronger than you know,” the dwarf continued, as he lightly hammered at a few of the worst elements of the piece. They reformed instantly under his touch.</p>

<p>“But sometimes, when the work is heavy, we must accept the strength of others, of other power.</p>

<p>“My strength is yours, and you know this,” he continued, the symbol around Brim’s neck glowing bright at the words, “but a new source of power has presented itself to you.”</p>

<p>As he spoke, a large symbol appeared in the center of the anvil, some type of magic rune or set of runes she didn’t recognize.</p>

<p>“This source of power is, in some ways, stronger than any I can give you,” the dwarf said, with a tinge of sadness. “But it comes with danger as well. It cannot guide you, cannot help you know when to use it. This you must learn for yourself.”</p>

<p>The god picked up a hammer, and held it over the rune.</p>

<p>“I will always do my best to guide you, Brimstone Mallerary,” he said. “And I may be able to shatter this new power here and now, if you wish to avoid it. But I have seen the work, made known, that lays before you. It is more than you will ever know.</p>

<p>“Do not make this choice lightly.” And he held out the hammer, which Brim gingerly grabbed, worried it may fall directly from her exhausted arm.</p>

<p>She held fast, and looked down at the mark. She didn’t need more help, did she? Dangerous help? Onatar would protect her… but only so much, she realized. Her mind flashed through the battle she had just endured, not two days after leaving home. If the world was such a dangerous place… perhaps dangerous power was needed to survive it.</p>

<p>Brim wished, fervently, that she knew more of the world, had more knowledge with which to make this decision. But she didn’t.</p>

<p>She set the hammer down lightly on the side of the anvil. The dwarf nodded solemnly.</p>

<p>“So the work begins, my child. Be brave. I am watching.”</p>

<p>Brim woke with a start. The piercing blue skies over Breland looked back down at her as she instinctively grasped at her symbol. She knew, knew, whatever she just experienced wasn’t just a dream. The symbol was still warm. The memories of it weren’t unraveling away from her like dreams. She felt the soft rumbling in her chest, so reminiscent of the dwarf’s voice.</p>

<p>She also knew, somehow, that the symbol she saw in her vision would be, now, somewhere upon her body. It took only a moment to find it, just there, upon her inner forearm.</p>

<p><em>My hammering muscles</em>, she thought, knowing how often her forearm muscles were called upon in her profession.</p>

<p>As she sat up, she saw Jab approaching from the other side of the ship.</p>

<p>“What happened?” she asked.</p>

<p>“Well… we teleported from the hold to here with the help of the little magic fox,” Jab replied. The fox, still on deck, yipped.</p>

<p>“And then you shot something at the bad people, and he dropped the barrel, and it opened and inside it was a weird ball,” he continued.</p>

<p>“And then that thing exploded and knocked us out and now I think we have dragonmarks!”</p>

<p>Jab beamed at Brim with the type of excitement she’d only ever seen on the Shavalant kids’ faces when the carnival came to town.</p>

<p>She rubbed slowly at the mark on her arm. It was definitely raised from her skin, slightly, and she could feel a slight vibration in it when she touched it.</p>

<p>“Oh, you’ve got one too!” Brim heard Jab as he bounded up, pointing at his own mark on his quad. Brim tried to contain it, but couldn’t prevent a giggle from escaping her.</p>

<p>“I guess I do,” she said, knowing full well that Onatar’s words (was it really him?) were about the only thing keeping her sane at the moment.</p>

<p>“Also, our pilot appears to be unconscious,” Jab continued, not quite grasping the change in tone that should’ve been necessary across that transition. “Should we get that healer girl to look at him?”</p>

<p>It was at this point that Ven and Snipe emerged from the cargo hold of the ship.</p>

<p>Both looked… okay? Snipe moreso, Brim thought. Ven looked like she’d seen a ghost, and was attempting very admirably to pretend that she hadn’t.</p>

<p>“Pilot?” she asked, with no further context. Jab nodded up at the cockpit in response.</p>

<p>“He’s not looking too… alive,” Jab said. “Unfortunately, we are very slowly, but nevertheless definitively, falling out of the sky.” He performed a quick mental calculation. “I suspect we have around 10 minutes until we crash into the treetops, if we don’t reverse it somehow.”</p>

<p>Brim looked over at Ven, who seemed to not like this news at all.</p>

<p>“Maybe we can fly the ship?” Brim asked, hoping for an easy solution.</p>

<p>Ven sighed.</p>

<p>“It takes a pilot with a Lyrandar mark — a Mark of Storms — to command the elemental. We might be able to keep ourselves airborne somehow, but we have little chance of actually moving the ship.”</p>

<p>Jab frowned. That wasn’t very optimistic.</p>

<p>“I have some healing abilities myself, Brim responded, “even though I’m not a healer. I have to cure a lot of banged and bruised fingers in the forge. Maybe we can patch up the pilot?”</p>

<p>Ven only nodded tersely, her shoulders heavy and resigned.</p>

<p>The group made their way over to the staircase.</p>

<p>“I tied that guy up!” Jab interjected as they passed the still unconscious body of the commanding assailant — and climbed up into the cockpit.</p>

<p>It took only a simple medical examination to determine the pilot had passed away.</p>

<hr />

<p>Ven could feel the blood beating in her ears. It passed hot across her upper back, where absolutely nothing was different about her. The other three were all looking at her expectantly.</p>

<p><em>What am I supposed to do?</em> She thought. <em>I’m no Lyrandar, not really. Mariel could fly this fucking thing.</em></p>

<p>She looked up from the body of the pilot and saw her small fox looking piercingly at her, expectantly.</p>

<p><em>What?</em> She thought. <em>Do YOU think there’s something I should do?</em></p>

<p>Ven had been in the company of this small creature for about four years now. She realized at this point that she should probably give it a name. But it had felt so foreign, just showing up at her tent when she woke the first time after… everything. <em>Maybe “Cinder”</em>, she thought, as it hiccuped a small puff of black smoke.</p>

<p>She still didn’t really understand what it was, exactly. It looked like a fox, albeit a bit… glowy. But whenever Ven got stressed, it seemed to burst, glowing with gentle flames. Over time, she learned she could issue it commands, simple ones at least.</p>

<p>But now, as it looked at her with flaming eyes, she realized it could also communicate with her.</p>

<p>“Mariel’s not here,” it seemed to say. “You are fire as much as I am. Command this elemental.”</p>

<p>Ven started. She hadn’t quite heard the words, not in any language at least, but the meaning was crystal clear in her mind.</p>

<p>“I can’t,” she thought back. “I’ll crash us into the ground.”</p>

<p>“We’re already crashing into the ground,” it seemed to think back.</p>

<p>Alright, Ven thought. Sassy fox then.</p>

<p>Ven had no further arguments. She stood up, facing the strange, metal rod that served as the only  control for the ship. Her fox jumped up onto the console, wrapping into a ball near the rod, still looking at her.</p>

<p>Feeling incredibly stupid, and feeling the eyes of the other three around her, she reached out her hands toward the rod.</p>

<p>Nothing happened. Or at least, it felt like nothing happened. She pushed, dipping into the magic she so recently manifested, but nothing was breaking through to the rod. She felt tears welling at the corners of her eyes.</p>

<p>As she struggled, her fox hummed slightly, egging her on.</p>

<p><em>Don’t think</em>, it seemed to say. <em>Just let it flow.</em></p>

<p>Ven took a deep breath, and held her hands back up again. Cupping the air around the rod, she tried not reaching for her magic, but the knowledge, lodged in her brain, of airship mechanics, of elemental control.</p>

<p>As she feebly attempted to persuade the elemental to move, via the seemingly inert rod, she felt the spot on her back — the spot she’d been resolutely ignoring — flare with warm energy.</p>

<p>Still resolutely ignoring the source of it, she watched in awe as energy began to flow between her fingertips and the metal rod in front of her.</p>

<p>She felt herself connect into the nexus, and instantly felt the crushing weight on her consciousness of a whipping, whirling fire elemental. Ven felt herself drowning in it, until she was shaken by the warmth of flame, as her fox jumped out and landed on her shoulder.
<em>Okay,</em> she thought. <em>Start simple</em>.</p>

<p>“Go.”</p>

<p>She tried to ignore the pressure of the elemental and just think the thought, loudly, with her whole mind. She tried first to think it in an  intimidating fashion, but abandoned this quickly in favor of a needling sort of begging.</p>

<p>*Can I really persuade this thing somehow? * she thought, not even noticing the surprise and relief on her companions’ faces as the Morning Zephyr began sliding forward through the sky.</p>
<h1 id="chapter-4">Chapter 4</h1>

<p>“I have one of those guys tied up out there,” Jab said, once Ven seemed to have gotten the hang of at least pointing the nose up and pushing the craft forward.</p>

<p>Brim, thinking straight for what seemed like the first time in minutes, considered the situation.</p>

<p>“I saw one of them destroying an important looking furnace thing down in the hold,” she responded. “I think it’s important to the ship somehow. Maybe you and Snipe can talk to the tied-up guy and I can go down there and see if I can fix it?”</p>

<p>She saw Snipe give a terse nod, and deduced that he had a bit more experience interrogating individuals than Jab.</p>

<p>Before stepping out of the cockpit, Brim turned to Ven, who was laser focused on her hands in front of her. She wanted to say a word of encouragement, but worried about breaking her concentration. Instead, she turned to the fox — close enough, she reckoned.</p>

<p>“Good job!” she said, flashing a thumbs up. The fox gave a small chirp in return and returned its attention to Ven.</p>

<p>Feeling rather special, Brim made her way through the trap door and down into the cargo hold. The place was a wreck, with destroyed crates laying about, contents spewed across the floor, and even the occasional hole in the hull.</p>

<p>At least we’re not underwater! She thought, idly, as she made her way to the center of the room where a large, stone furnace sat, seemingly inert.</p>

<p>She peered around it, eventually dipping into her magic to sense any magical aura it might possess. It didn’t take long for her to piece together that this thing — which had a table attached to it that seemed to be stocked with boxes of inky-dark dragonshards — powered the nexus that connected the pilot to the elemental, and which kept the elemental bound to the ship.</p>

<p>It also looked significantly damaged. Inside the engine, Brim could see cracks and breaks cutting across the inset troughs and lines of arcane energy. She recognized the channels from her time out on the beam.</p>

<p>Shuddering slightly, she attempted to mend it the same way she did the ring. Nothing. She pushed harder, but while her mending seemed to push some of the stone into place, she could feel, somewhere on an arcane plane, that the underlying object, or at least the enchantment on it, remained broken.</p>

<p>It was at this point that a conversation she’d had with the rather unwilling captain the day she arrived pushed through the adrenaline of the fight.</p>

<p>“The airships are constructed by both House Cannith and the Zil gnomes,” Hass had said. “They’re the only ones who can construct and repair ‘em, but Lyrandar are the only ones who can fly the thrice damned things. So they get all the glory.”</p>

<p>Brim frowned at the nexus engine. She wasn’t a member of House Cannith, nor was she a gnome, obviously.</p>

<p>Almost out of spite, she reached forward a hand into the seemingly inert forge, and looked at her forearm, where the new, red and black symbol pulsed slowly.</p>

<p>Maybe this mark can fool it, she thought, half joking. But when she attempted to pull energy from the mark, rather than the wellspring deep within her chest, she felt it flow easily, like water over smooth rocks, through her fingertips and into the forge.</p>

<p>Brim could feel her own energy draining — almost alarmingly fast — but she was spellbound by the blueish, almost healing energy that was extending from each fingertip and spreading out into all the cracks and channels of the engine.</p>

<p>Moments later, it hummed to life, the channels glowing blue the way they had out on the beam. Brim, grinning in her success, felt a wave of dizziness overcome her.</p>

<p><em>Yikes!</em> She thought. <em>I hope this doesn’t happen every time.</em> Then she dropped, unceremoniously, to the ground, stars dancing in her vision.</p>

<hr />

<p>The man — revealed as such once his balaclava had been removed — spat at Jab’s feet.</p>

<p>“I tell you nothing,” he said in a thick accent Snipe assumed was Karrnathi.</p>

<p>“Actually, you’ve already told us quite a bit,” Snipe responded, pacing the deck near the tied up attacker.</p>

<p>“You told us one of your friend’s names, down in the hold — Aja, was it? And you even mentioned the name of whatever it is you were here to steal. So let me ask you this: what’s a dragonseye?”</p>

<p>The figure stared at him defiantly for several moments, before eyeing his Snipe’s rapier and slowly sounding out</p>

<p>“My name… is S’barin,” he said, answering what was evidently an easier question.</p>

<p>“Great!” Jab responded brightly. “So S’barn. I have 2 questions. One. Do you know what happened to us? With the big explosion from the thing you dropped? And two. Do you desire to learn the secrets of heredity and aging concealed from the Warforged race—”</p>

<p>Snipe placed a gentle hand out, cutting Jab off.</p>

<p>“Start with the first one,” he said.</p>

<p>S’barin grinned.</p>

<p>“It seems you all experienced dragonseye, saw the power. You don’t need me to tell you what it does.”</p>

<p>He looked over to Jab, still pantsless,  and gestured over at the dragonmark on his quad.</p>

<p>“I have not seen one on a Warforged,” he continued. “But it would appear we are brothers. Welcome to the family.”</p>

<p>Snipe felt a wave of unease wash through him.</p>

<p><em>So my hunch was correct,</em> he thought.* We’ve somehow been…granted aberrant dragonmarks.*</p>

<p>“Who do you work for,” Snipe asked, trying his best to hide the slight quiver in his voice. Aberrant mark-bearers were not treated kindly in most of Khorvaire.</p>

<p>“Now this I cannot say,” S’barin replied, tugging slightly at the ropes. “I have my oaths, as I’m sure you have yours.”</p>

<p>Snipe waved to Jab and took a few steps away from their prisoner.</p>

<p>“I don’t think he’s going to say much,” Snipe whispered. “We could probably break a grunt or hired help, but this guy seems to be a team leader and deeply embedded in whatever’s going on.”</p>

<p>“Are you sure?” Jab responded. “He seems pretty friendly, all things considered.”</p>

<p>Snipe gave a short laugh.</p>

<p>“People often turn friendly when it’s their life on the line. If he weren’t in those ropes, I think it’d be a different story. Speaking of, where did you learn to tie up prisoners?”</p>

<p>“I didn’t!” Jab responded. “I just wrapped it around and tied it a few times.”</p>

<p>It was at this point that Snip and Jab looked, simultaneously, back over to the suspiciously quiet prisoner, and saw the coil of rope on the deck and the shadow of his form rolling over the edge of the ship.</p>

<p>“Dolurrh!” Snipe exclaimed, sprinting over to the edge of the deck and peering over. Rapidly descending toward the trees, S’barin gave him a congenial wave.</p>

<p>Snipe considered shooting a crossbow bolt down at him, then sighed. He heard Jab come up next to him.</p>

<p>“Whoops. Yeah, I guess my knot-tying wasn’t amazing. But like you said, he wasn’t going to say anything more right?”</p>

<p>“Right…” Snipe winced. “But we’re about to enter Sharn on a half-destroyed airship littered with dead bodies. I’m not sure I trust in the city’s authorities to ascertain that it wasn’t us who carried out this massacre.”</p>

<p>“Oh…”</p>

<p>Turning away from the edge of the ship, Snipe began formulating plans.</p>

<p><em>Could I jump from the ship into the city before we dock?</em> he mused, quickly scrapping the idea. <em>How do I get off this damned ship…</em></p>

<p>The next few hours passed by in a haze. Brim spent most of it mending small elements of the ship as best she could — especially elements of the nexus. Anything to make Ven’s flying attempts easier. Snipe, still grinding through plans for his next steps, took on the task of moving and arranging the bodies onto the forward deck of the ship, covering them with some tarp. Jab mostly kept Ven company in the cockpit. Secretly, she was thankful for the chattering.</p>
<h1 id="chapter-5">Chapter 5</h1>

<p><em>The scale of the City of Towers is staggering. Built within an abnormally large manifest zone linked to the outer plane of Syriana, the city stretches skyward with an audacity that defies both gravity and even the most powerful magic.</em></p>

<p><em>Buoyed by the levitational nudge of the plane of endless skies, Sharn begins, at its base, with five massive, cloistered towers, each filling to the brim one of five closely separated mesas. These are the lower city, and they rise like massive supports more than three thousand feet before their flat tops are requisitioned for the building of Middle Sharn.</em></p>

<p><em>Here, the five towers, (roughly matching the mesa widths below) divide into five to ten towers each, all built on the foundation of the lower city. Where almost all of the lower city is indoors, here, the first outdoor thoroughfares connect the main towers and cross the gaps between the mesas via massive bridges.</em></p>

<p><em>Even these five to ten towers can scarcely be called “buildings” — they are wider in radius than many villages, shooting upward another thousand feet with ease, with uncountable balconies and bridges interconnecting different towers. These towers then top out as well, and upon them is built the Upper City.</em></p>

<p><em>Here, finally, the towers created can be described as buildings, with ten to several hundred of these more narrow structures crowding each base like stalagmites, interconnected by bridges and platforms and impossibly wide terrace.</em></p>

<hr />

<p>As the sun began to set below the Brelish horizon, casting long, bloodred rays across the treetops of the King’s forest below, Ven, still standing at the helm of the Zephyr, just began to make out what appeared to be a lone, singular mountain dead ahead to the south. As they drew nearer, that mountain revealed itself as not a mountain, but rather a massive, raised stone mesa, and from it, in turn, rose the city of towers.</p>

<p>As the Morning Zephyr limped its way toward the shining city, the evening light filtering through the thousands of buildings, reflecting and refracting through the smoke of food being prepared and workshops operating at full steam, Brim and Jab stood utterly transfixed at the forward bow. Sharn had that effect on people.</p>

<p>Snipe was fairly used to the sight of the city; he’d grown up here, and it remained his primary home, though he was rarely there. Still, he had to admit that the sight of the city from altitude, in the airship, took his breath away a little bit.</p>

<p>Ven tried her best not to look at the city, focusing her energy on the elemental. It had grown easier over time — So far, she’d needed no commands other than “Go.” She didn’t have to command it constantly, either. Once the elemental complied, it generally continued to for some time. Whenever she felt it grow restless and begin trying to burn wildly in new directions, she reiterated the command. She was exceedingly thankful the weather remained beautiful and calm.</p>

<p>The ship itself remained in a state of constant descent, due to the amount of soarwood that had been lost,  but Jab, Brim, and Snipe had managed to jury-rig several of the airfoils to give the nose a positive pitch attitude. Just barely, the forward acceleration from the elemental was enough to keep them airborne. 
She shuddered to think about the prospects of docking the ship in Sharn, laughing grimly at the knowledge that if she accidentally crashed into Lyrandar tower, her family would probably not be surprised. They all thought she hated them.</p>

<p><em>It would be quite the entrance</em>, she thought, affording herself a short, barking laugh. <em>So, mother, you wanted to see me?</em></p>

<p>Ven could smell the sweet, savory scents of the city reach her nose as they began flying over the tops of the buildings in the Northedge quarter. It had always amazed her that a city of this size didn’t smell awful — the power of a million prestidigitations being cast throughout the day.</p>

<p>Only a few minutes later, Ven saw the telltale set of towers rising from the Central Plateau into the Upper City. Dragon Towers — the enclaves of the dragonmarked houses in the city. And rising taller than the rest was Lyrander tower.</p>

<p>Though she had called this place home for the first decade or two of her life, it looked almost unrecognizable from the cockpit of the Zephyr. The top quarter of the tower had all been built in the decade she’d been gone, presumably to facilitate the docking and furnishing of airships.</p>

<p>She could see that there were five docks, each a Y-shaped set of platforms extending from the tower in a pentagonal configuration. It seemed clear the nose of the ship was meant to nestle into the “v” of the dock — Ven realized the structure was meant to allow access to the ship without interfering with the elemental ring.</p>

<p>There were several open docks; Ven had no clue which was their agreed-upon berth. The ship’s sending stone was mounted in the console just next to her, but without a Zil communicator it was useless. She’d even taken a moment to try to use it, but her newfound powers did not seem to extend that far.</p>

<p>Shrugging, she aimed for the dock closest to their angle of approach, and settled in to try a new set of commands with the elemental.</p>

<p>“Slow,” she commanded.</p>

<p>Nothing happened, and Ven almost immediately realized that stopping this ship was going to be considerably harder than getting it going.</p>

<p><em>Elementals want nothing more than to burn hard and wild,</em> she thought, remembering the line from some academic text she’d read as a child.</p>

<p>She growled, and tried again.</p>

<p>“STOP,” she commanded, as they were now less than a hundred feet from the dock. “STOP.”</p>

<p>She felt herself breaking through, and after a small petulant flare from the ring, the forward push on the ship ceased. Carried forward by its own moderate momentum, the ship coasted into the “v” of the dock.</p>

<p>Her timing had not been great. She watched helplessly through the windows as dock hands, waiting expectantly for a smooth, clean stop, dived out of the way as the front of the ship smashed into the dock.</p>

<p>It wasn’t a terrible collision — damage was done to both the dock and ship, certainly, but both survived relatively intact. Ven suspected the dock had some kind of protective enchantment on it for precisely these types of situations.</p>

<p>Breathing for what felt like the first time in hours, she dropped her hands to her side, relinquishing control of the vessel. She could see through the windows that the dockhands were now, in some righteous anger, tying up the ship using lines tossed down by Jab and Brim, and dealing with the confusion of the ship immediately beginning to sink down below the dock.</p>

<p>Ven walked out onto the deck, joining the others as she heard Jab calling down,</p>

<p>“We have some lift issues, so please get this ship tied before we slip down into the city!”</p>

<p>Ven watched silently, willing her hands — which had begun shaking rather violently after she released the tension of piloting — to still. She closed her eyes, until she felt a tap on her shoulder.</p>

<p>“We’ve got a gangplank,” Brim said, softly, as she opened her eyes. “You did a great job flying the ship, by the way! I was super impressed.” Ven swallowed and nodded, and felt a small bit of warmth flow to her through Brim’s smile.</p>

<p><em>That girl is really something</em>, she thought.* I wonder if I used to be that… hopeful.*</p>

<p>Taking Brim’s hand, she was boosted up onto the gangplank that had been set up to the dock. Trying not to look down, she stepped carefully across it and set foot, for the first time in a decade, back in Sharn.</p>

<p>“Sovereign’s above! Ven, is that you? What in Eberron are you doing on a transport ship?”</p>

<p>Ven looked up at the voice, recognition already dawning on her. Standing on the dock, surrounded by Lyrandar aides and guards, was Mia Toradin d’Lyrandar: sorcerer of storms, personal assistant to Solia Selavir, and, once, Ven’s closest friend beyond her brother. 
“Mia?” Ven tried to respond, finding herself at a loss for words. The woman, several years older than Ven and now rocking distinctly silver hair, threw her arms around her.</p>

<p>“We weren’t expecting you for another week!” she said into Ven’s shoulders. The soft lilt of her voice washed over Ven like a warm blanket. “Let me look at you.”</p>

<p>Mia held Ven out at arms-length, her eyes — which were a glowing, golden hazel and had always been wise beyond their years — appraised Ven with an efficiency that Ven knew marked her usefulness to the house. She felt momentarily naked, stripped of any armor as the woman peered into the decade of her life she’d missed.</p>

<p>Whatever it is she saw in Ven, she only cupped a hand to her cheek and smiled sadly, before turning to face them all as a group.</p>

<p>“Right,” she began. “So I’m up here on the docks because this transport vessel —she looked down at a register in her hand — the <em>Morning Zephyr</em> — was supposed to arrive more than an hour ago. But instead, I began hearing reports from the Brelish countryside about an airship half exploding and going up in flames not a hundred leagues out from Sharn.”</p>

<p>She looked, keenly, at the Zephyr, making quick note of the holes and scorch marks.</p>

<p>“I’ll wager a galifar and a half that those reports were referring to you all. As you’re the only ones who disembarked the ship, which, mind, was not registered to be carrying any passengers, I can only assume that something quite terrible has transpired.”</p>

<p>Mia turned to look at Ven, continuing to address the group. “Solia put in an order to hold off the Sharn Watch until I’d assessed the situation, and made sure there’s no House interests at risk. They’re currently downstairs, being treated to tea and biscuits, but we haven’t much time before they come poking around. I’d appreciate it greatly if you could accompany me into the tower and fill me in on — she gestured lightly at the ship, which in its damaged state strained at the ropes now holding it up — all of this.”</p>

<p>The group followed Mia down the dock and into the main terminal at the top of Lyrandar tower. Even Ven found herself looking around in slight awe. Far above them, a massive dome, painted with an intricate fresco of a golden sunset sky that undulated with illusion magic to make the painted clouds — and Lyrandar ships that floated through them — appear to drift across the dome.</p>

<p>Along the walls of the cylindrical chamber, between the five arched openings that led out onto the docks, were small inset cubbies within which were parked small carts that sizzled aromatically as a lucky few street merchants prepared and hawked food to the waiting passengers.</p>

<p>Mia led the group through one of the waiting areas, where nice sets of chairs were laid out for the select members of society who could afford airship travel, toward a large, grand, spiraling staircase leading down to a lower level of the tower.</p>

<p>They emerged into a large, fairly sleek room that appeared to be the front office of the enclave. Half-elves, dressed in Lyrandar’s blues, yellows, and greens, moved with purpose around the chamber, disappearing into doors spread around the sides. Civilians, some clearly travellers with trunks, others simply there on unrelated business, milled about before a set of large wooden desks where they were helped by waiting members of the House.</p>

<p>“This way,” Mia said, opening a small, nondescript door with a small wave of her hand. They entered a long, curving hallway — shockingly bare and functional compared to the public facing halls outside.</p>

<p>Ven remembered these halls; unlike those out in the center of the tower, these private corridors were where her and Jaresh first roamed free, before they escalated to sneaking out of the tower and into Sharn proper.</p>

<p>With a final wave of a hand, Mia led them into a small, functional office. A clean wooden desk separated the halves of the room, behind it rested a rather uncomfortable looking chair. Behind that, a window looked out over the Central Plateau, as the twinkle of everlight lanterns in the post-sunset towers filtered into the room. Ven noticed the two simple bookshelves flanking the windows were filled with some rather advanced books on sorcery.</p>

<p>There were only two seats on the near side of the desk. Ven and Brim sat down, Jab and Snipe hovering over their shoulders. Ven could feel the tension in Snipe’s muscles from where she sat — the man clearly wanted out of this place.</p>

<p>“So,” Mia said. “What can you tell me about this airship incident?”</p>

<p>Ven shot a look back at Snipe.</p>

<p><em>How much should we say,</em> she wondered. She knew he was the most likely to tell a highly censored version of events.</p>

<p>“I think it’d be best if Snipe here laid it out. He had a good view of what happened,” she said.</p>

<p>Ven saw Jab almost say something, then hold back, as Snipe began to speak.</p>

<p>“Pretty simple actually,” he said, too nonchalantly. “Another airship emerged from above and dropped some attackers onto our ship. They were powerful magic users — made quick work of the crew, we just about survived. Mostly because we spent less time fighting them and more time trying to put out fires and repair damage to the ship, keep us in the air, you know?”</p>

<p>Mia nodded thoughtfully.</p>

<p>“I don’t think anyone can deny your ship was attacked,” she responded. “Do you know what they were after?”</p>

<p>Snipe paused, before replying measuredly,</p>

<p>“No. As I said, they didn’t really concern themselves with us. And as you mentioned before, we were just last minute, off the books passengers. If there was anything valuable in that cargo hold, we wouldn’t know what it is.”</p>

<hr />

<p>Jab found himself in a deep state of confusion. The overwhelming, mind-numbing scale of Sharn’s towers notwithstanding, the final moments of their journey had seen Snipe demand he find pants to wear to cover his mark, introduced him to a mage that Ven seemed to already know, and now, Snipe was lying to this woman about what happened on the airship.</p>

<p>He could sense, innately, that this all revolved around the marks. For some reason, Snipe — and Ven too, he realized — felt that it was in their interests not to share that particular piece of the story with Mia. Even though Ven seemed to be close to her?</p>

<p>As Mia and Snipe traded information, Ven occasionally stepping in with clarifications, Jab turned to Brim and tried his best to look quizzical.</p>

<p>She seemed to get it. She raised an eyebrow at him and gave a small shrug, seemingly content to let the other two handle whatever half-truth story was being weaved.</p>

<p>“… the pilot hung on, bravely, till we were over the city,” Ven was finishing, not sounding entirely convinced herself. “I took over then. Of course, I don’t have a mark, but I was able to push just enough to get us onto a course with the tower.”</p>

<p>Mia nodded. “It has been reported that non-stormmarked individuals have on occasion been able to take command of an airship, at least briefly… It takes a powerful degree of mental fortitude, you should be impressed.” Brim saw Mia looking at Ven carefully. It was a look her own mother, Obsidian, had given her, from time to time. Like a disbelief that she was growing up.</p>

<p>“Well,  a Lyrandar pilot murdered is certainly a big deal,” she continued. “This is quite the story. First and foremost, I’m glad you all are safe. And thanks to all of you,” she said, gesturing to Brim, Jab, and Snipe, “for helping keep Ven safe. I wouldn’t want to lose her…”</p>

<p>It passed in an instant, but Brim clocked the catch in Mia’s throat, an unspoken “again” hovering at the end of the sentence.</p>

<p>Mia stood up abruptly.</p>

<p>“I’m afraid the Watch has made it clear that they shall be delayed no longer. I’m told they have seen the ship, and wish now to speak to you.”</p>

<p>She leaned in, and spoke again in a low voice.</p>

<p>“Tell them nothing you did not tell me… and in fact, feel free not to tell them all you told me. The Watch is not… the body I would trust with the solving of this particular crime.” And with that, she swept out of the room.</p>

<p>Jab heard Brim let out a long breath. Seizing his chance, he turned to Snipe and Ven and said</p>

<p>“Hey, how come you didn’t tell Mia about what actually happened?”</p>

<p>Snipe seemed to jump, glancing nervously around the room, until Ven said</p>

<p>“Don’t worry. I guarantee it is in Mia’s best interests to keep any divination or scrying out of this chamber.”</p>

<p>Snipe nodded, but still looked marginally on edge. Ven continued,</p>

<p>“Jab, I didn’t want to lie to Mia. I’m sure you all noticed that we have some history together. I guess it’s time to say that I never gave you my last name… but formally, it’s Lyrandar.”</p>

<p>“Woahhhh,” Jab said, as Brim whistled. “Is that why you could fly the ship?”</p>

<p>Ven shrugged.</p>

<p>“Anyways,” she continued, “There’s a lot at play here that we don’t understand. Mia is a good person, but the House, as an institution… let’s just say they wouldn’t hesitate to sacrifice you, or me, or any of us, to protect a family secret.”</p>

<p>Ven reached into her pack, and pulled out a small, black ledger.</p>

<p>“I found this on the captain. It’s a log of all the Morning Zephyr’s trips, and what he was carrying. It was super meticulous. This trip… it’s not in here.”</p>

<p>As Snipe took the book and began looking it over, Brim offered,</p>

<p>“Well maybe he adds his trips after they’re completed?”</p>

<p>“Yeah, maybe,” Ven said. “But I don’t know. Something feels wrong to me. Everything that happened — that was powerful magic they were using. Almost nothing would be worth an all out attack in broad daylight like that. But that thing…” she trailed off.</p>

<p>“It’s clearly extremely dangerous. Who was it being brought here for? If it’s Lyrandar, we could all be in grave danger if we admit that we saw or interacted with it.”</p>

<p>Jab spent a moment processing this. Ven was clearly a naturally suspicious person — he knew that from the moment he introduced himself to her. But there was a nugget of truth to what she was saying, even if, as she said, none of them knew how yet.</p>

<p>“All I’m saying,” she said, finishing as the sound of footsteps approached down the marble hallway, “is that we keep some cards in our hand for now.”</p>

<p>The analogy sat well with him.</p>

<p><em>Alright,</em> he thought.* We’re not lying, we’re just delaying the truth until we know who we can trust. …Man, Sharn’s a strange place.*</p>

<hr />

<p>“Brim, I think you should tell the story this time,” Ven said, as Brim felt a small shock of surprise hit her.</p>

<p>“Me?” she said, looking sharply at Snipe. “Do I… remember well enough?” she asked pointedly.</p>

<p>“I’m sure you do,” Ven replied. “My voice is tired.”</p>

<p>Brim turned and looked at the two figures standing in front of them. One, a dwarf roughly half her height, had jumped up onto Mia’s chair and was now looking at them at roughly eye level.</p>

<p>“I’m Detective Sblamtham,” he had said, prompting a slight giggle from Brim that he stared into silence with daggers. “And this is my partner, Oneed. We have some questions for you.”</p>

<p>Brim reiterated the group’s adopted story as best she could, sidestepping the more challenging questions with a cascade of “I was on fire at that point” and “It was hard to see through the smoke” responses.</p>

<p>The detective was clearly unsatisfied, but eventually Mia re-entered the room and informed him that Lyrandar tower was closing, and they would have to return the next day if they wanted to further question these guests of the house. Brim noticed a very pointed edge to that “guest of the house” line, and began to slowly catch a glimpse of the complexity of politics and jurisdictions at play in this city.</p>

<p>As Sblamtham left the room, Oneed reached out a hand to shake hers, with a formal</p>

<p>“Thank you for your time. Please stay in the city so we can reach you with any further questions.”</p>

<p>Pulling his hand away, Brim felt the rough sensation of paper against her skin, and looked down to see a small, handwritten note left behind in her palm.</p>
<h1 id="chapter-6">Chapter 6</h1>

<p>Brim let out a long whistle.</p>

<p>“Hey, uh, I think we might not be able to play our cards as close to the chest as we imagined.”</p>

<p>As the others looked at her quizzically, she held out the small note she had been palmed.</p>

<p><em>“I know what’s happened to you in the skies. About the… change. You aren’t safe. Talk to no one. Come to the Lightsbridge Tavern at 10-hour. – An ally.”</em></p>

<p>Brim could hear the small smatterings of curses being uttered under breaths, particularly from Snipe and Ven.</p>

<p>“It seems impossible to me that someone could know about all that,” she said, “Only people aboard the ship could have possibly known.”</p>

<p>Ven nodded gravely. “So this note is either from someone with extreme powers of surveillance, or it’s a trap, and it’s from the people who attacked us.”</p>

<p>“What would they want with us now?” Jab asked. “They presumably got the thing they were there for… that dragonseye thing?”</p>

<p>“Loose ends,” Snipe said with a low growl.</p>

<p>Something about that didn’t sit quite right with Brim.</p>

<p>“Whoever this is got us this note, right?” she began, sounding out her thoughts. “So they have power within the Sharn Watch, and our attackers didn’t seem like they’d have that kind of sway. If they did, they wouldn’t need to attack the airship, they could just smuggle the thing off it somehow.</p>

<p>“And why would an attacker invite us to a crowded place like a tavern in order to kill us? If they knew we were here, right now, presumably they could take us out at their own discretion.”</p>

<p>She shuddered a bit at the thought, but noticed a thoughtful look from Ven.</p>

<p>“I think Brim’s right,” Ven said. “Or at least, whatever’s going on, this note, delivered this way, doesn’t seem like the style of the people we fought. So…”</p>

<p>The question hung unspoken in the air for a moment before she concluded, “Are we going?”</p>

<p>Snipe still looked unconvinced, but Jab nodded slowly.</p>

<p>“I think for all that’s happened, we’re currently in the dark about a lot of things. Whoever wrote this clearly has information. If we can stay safe, we might learn something that helps us moving forward, even if we don’t volunteer anything ourselves.”</p>

<p>Brim looked around the group, and realized in a sudden rush that she was absolutely starving.</p>

<p>“Do you think… we might have time to eat some food before?” she asked.</p>

<p>Almost in response to the question, she heard the growling of stomachs and the sheen of hunger crossed her companions’ faces. They were all beaten to hell, and food sounded incredible.</p>

<p>“I know of Lightsbridge, though I’ve never been inside,” Ven said. “It’s in Upper Menthis. There’ll be plenty of other taverns and streetcars selling food up there. We’ll need a skycoach to get there though, there’s no way in hell I’m walking the bridges in this state.”</p>

<p>Brim nodded, not entirely sure she understood the majority of what Ven had just said. Ven noted the confusion and smiled slightly.</p>

<p>“Sorry. There are five main quarters in the city, for the five mesas. We’re in Central now, the others are Menthis, which is like, theaters and taverns and entertainment, Dura, which is mostly merchants, Northedge, which is residential, and Tavick’s Landing, which is a mix.</p>

<p>``We’re also in the upper city right now. The character of each quarter changes from upper to middle to lower, in the way you might expect. At broad strokes, you can locate a place by tagging it as I did — Upper Central, Middle Menthis, etc. There are also neighborhoods within each… but don’t worry about that right now,” she trailed off.</p>

<p>Brim nodded, filing away the information and noting that Jab had actually pulled a small notebook out, and was jotting down these tidbits in real time.</p>

<p>“There are some bridges that connect the quarters at most levels,” Ven continued. “Those are free, but take forever to navigate to and from and if you fall…” she made a long falling gesture with her fingers. “Skycoaches are probably the best way around, albeit pricy.”</p>

<p>Brim heard a knock at the door, and Mia poked her head in once more.</p>

<p>“I’ve gotten rid of those Watch detectives for the evening,” she said, with a cadence that indicated she’d done the same before. “Ven, Solia is going to want to speak with you, but she’s out of the enclave on business tonight. I can of course have your room set up—”</p>

<p>“No, thank you,” Ven broke in. “I have a place elsewhere in the city. But I’ll be sure to stop by to see… her… in the coming days.”</p>

<p>Brim thought Mia looked a little hurt at this, but accepted it in stride.</p>

<p>“Very well. If it’s alright, then, I do have some work to do and would kindly ask you to vacate my office. I’ll have more to ask about the airship situation in the coming days, but for now, it looks like you all could use a hot meal and, like, 72 hours of sleep.”</p>

<p>With a small chorus of thank yous and goodbyes, the group made their way out of Mia’s office, back into the central areas of Lyrandar tower. Exiting via a massive arched doorway, Brim’s eyes quickly accustomed to the night view of the city. Before them was a massive, bustling city square — the open air to the stars above indicated they must be in the upper city — and around its perimeter, entrances to 13 towers. Hundreds of city-goers traversed the large space, and a variety of food carts and entertainers dotted the square at regular intervals.</p>

<p>“Those are the other dragonmarked houses enclaves,” Ven said, begrudgingly taking on the role of tour guide. “Most of the business of the enclaves is actually held below, in Middle Central, but most upper city folk will enter dragon towers here before heading down.</p>

<p>Brim heard a small grunt from Snipe.</p>

<p>“Yeah,” he confirmed. “I grew up in Sharn too… never really came to the upper city at all, though.”</p>

<p>Brim turned to him as they began walking, Ven scouring the sky above for coaches.</p>

<p>“You said you worked for a guild right? Death something?”</p>

<p>“Deathsgate,” he confirmed. “It’s less macabre than it sounds, it’s named for the neighborhood it’s in, over in Middle Tavick’s, which is right above the city of the dead, Sharn’s graveyard. But the name fits — most of whom you’ll find there were soldiers in the war, and they do the jobs the Clifftop Guild would turn its nose up at.”</p>

<p>Brim slowly began trying to piece together all this new information, realizing in waves that this city was like a nation in and of itself.</p>

<p>Up ahead, Ven threw up a hand and a small burst of arcane light spiraled up from it like a beacon. Spiraling down from above, what appeared to be a long, slender rowboat, albeit sans oars, drew up beside their group. Sitting in the back, a young halfling, looking barely older than a child to Brim, peered at them.</p>

<p>“Where to?” they asked, with a strong accent that made the phrase sound like “Ehr, tui?”</p>

<p>“Upper Menthis,” Ven said, climbing aboard. The rest followed suit. As Brim pushed off the ground to step up into the coach, she felt a strange turn of gravity beneath her feet, as if she were suddenly much lighter. Her trajectory into the coach had a graceful arc, but she had overcommitted, and nearly fell over the other edge of the coach before Jab grabbed her arm.</p>

<p>“Ayee, first time!” came a gleeful exclamation from their pilot. Brim felt her cheeks grow a little flushed.</p>

<p>“Don’t worry,” Ven said, attempting a smile but mostly looking tired. “It’s the manifest zone. The reason Sharn could be built so tall, the reason the skycoaches work, is that we’re sort of… sharing overlapping space with the Syrania plane.</p>

<p>“Usually you don’t notice it, but if you put your awareness to the superposition, you can temporarily find your physics controlled by Syrania. It happens more often to magical folk, or when interacting with things like skycoaches that are doing this continuously.”</p>

<p>By now, they’d departed Dragon Towers and were soaring up above the city. Several of the spires still extended above their altitude, but the majority of the city was below. Much like their airship — Sovereigns, was that today?  — a delicate foil at the front of their skycoach left the air relatively smooth and still despite their speed.</p>

<p>“Do you know Lightsbridge Tavern?” Ven asked the pilot. After a split second of his hesitation, she shook her head and said “Just drop us at Morgrave.”</p>

<p>They continued winding through buildings, over and under long, spindling bridges, and finally burst out onto a sudden, yawning chasm.</p>

<p>“We’re between the plateaus now,” Snipe said, looking somewhat trepidatiously over the edge of the coach. Brim tried to look, but the dark, mile-deep depth seemed, somehow, much more foreboding in the tiny rocking form of their skycoach.</p>

<p>Soon, though, they re-emerged over the cityscape again. The upper city of Menthis Plateau was at a slightly lower elevation than Upper Central, and already the change in character was clear — music was audible from numerous directions, colorful sparks of magic, fireworks, and large magically illuminated signs danced off the sides of various towers. There was more open spaces created here, where indoor taverns and theaters spilled out into rowdy tables and impromptu casinos.</p>

<p>After a few minutes of taking this in, the skycoach narrowly threaded two buildings connected by numerous bridges, and emerged into the most open space Brim had seen in this city thus far. On one side of this massive square, an ornate, domed building with a fancy columnated facade stood proudly over the rectangular space; behind it, several connected towers with their own smaller domes rose toward the heavens.</p>

<p>The square itself was greener than most, long hedgeways and greenery had been planted, leaving it looking like a loose maze. Toward the other end of the square, a massive theater, with gracefully curving archways stood, patrons currently milling about its front.</p>

<p>All around the other edges of the square, large taverns with outdoor tables vied for real estate into the square proper, and Brim could see that extending behind the large theater was a whole neighborhood of what appeared to be nothing but food and drink establishments.</p>

<p>“Welcome to Upper Menthis,” Ven said as the skycoach alighted just above the square. They hopped out, Ven tossing a few sovereigns to the driver. “That’s Morgrave University over there,” she said, pointing to the massive domed building and it’s towers. “Not the best university in the world, but one of the biggest. Mostly they learn to go steal shit from Xen’drik and bring it back to ogle over and sell… I mean study.”</p>

<p>Brim made a mental note of this, then turned to follow her companions through the crowded, colorful streets of Sharn.</p>

<hr />

<p>Jab looked on as Ven wound her way through the street ahead of him. Up close, it turned out that while the majority of these streets were lined with dive bars and taverns, there were also a surprising number of small theatres and burlesques tucked between them. Patrons seemed to flow seamlessly between the two forms of entertainment.</p>

<p>Taverns were always a strange experience for Jab. He enjoyed the people watching, and the few he’d been in, though much smaller and quieter than these, were good places to practice his speech. But he had no need (nor ability) to consume food or drink, and found himself feeling often left out of the fun in such locales. Not to mention the odd sensation of watching others slip progressively into inebriation in real time while remaining sober.</p>

<p>Perhaps that’s why he was so interested in cooking. For as most of his short life, he’d had an urge to cook, or make drinks — anything to be a part of the overall experience of dining. So far, he’d been… not particularly successful. Not being able to taste  your own creations put a pretty hard limit on how quickly he could learn.</p>

<p>He found himself wondering if perhaps these new friends would sample some of his food and give him feedback. 	 Were they his friends? The thought splashed almost innocuously across his mind. He’d never had any reason to think of anyone as unfriendly before, and so far, that had gotten him to where he was just fine. And these folks had just saved each other’s lives, more or less. And the marks, he felt himself thinking, almost unprompted, with a tingle in his quad where the new dragonmark throbbed ever so lightly.</p>

<p><em>What was that about?</em> he wondered silently, itching to talk about it with the group but knowing, somehow, that this was still a bad idea. Maybe their mysterious contact could tell them more.</p>

<p>The Lightsbridge Tavern was a rollicking establishment located — obviously, in hindsight — upon a large thoroughfare bridge connecting two towers in the district. The wide bridge had festive, sparking lights passing down its center, and a steady thrum of people walked its length, stopping to peruse the shops and stalls lining its edges. In the center of the bridge, seemingly unsupported from below, the tavern jutted out over the expanse between the towers.</p>

<p>Jab could see three levels of seating, all on open balconies that looked out over the space between the two neighborhoods. The place was packed.</p>

<p>“Ugh,” he heard Ven groan from the vanguard of their party. “All tourists.”</p>

<p>Jab exchanged a sheepish look with Brim, knowing they were both soaking in the place with a fair amount of apparently undeserved awe.</p>

<p>Ven, ahead of him, squared her shoulders and seemed to gather herself, before powering through the crowds towards the door of the tavern. After they made it inside, Ven leaned over to him and yelled over the din,</p>

<p>“You’re taller than me, can you see anywhere a little less crowded to sit?”</p>

<p>He began searching, subconsciously filtering out the noise of the place to aid his focus. He sensed vibrations in the floor from around him, and above, and then turned back to Ven.</p>

<p>“I think we might have more luck on the balcony of the floor above! There seem to be less people.”</p>

<p>His instincts were correct, and before long, the group had nestled into a corner of the top deck at a small circular table.</p>

<p>“It’s around 9-hour now,” Snipe said. “So anyone who wants to eat or drink, do it now. We don’t know what’s gonna happen after that.”</p>

<p>It was a bit of a wait, but a barmaid eventually made her way over to the table, listing off a set of food specialties they were serving that night, and putting in a pitch for their “world-wide famous cocktail, the Featherfall.”</p>

<p>“Yes,” Brim responded, nodding. 
“Yes to…”</p>

<p>“To everything you just said,” Brim responded, seemingly confused.</p>

<p>“Ah… okay then!” The barmaid wandered off as Ven groaned again.</p>

<p>“Brim, do you have any idea how much that food’s going to cost at a place like this?”</p>

<p>Brim looked suddenly nervous.</p>

<p>“Oh no! I’m sorry. I’ll totally pay for it! And share with the group of course!”</p>

<p>Ven just shook her head slowly.</p>

<p>Jab, meanwhile, stood up and looked out across the tavern to where the bar was located. He wanted to see how that featherfall drink was made.</p>

<p>“It’s definitely not their thing,” Ven said, noticing him stand. “But it’s popular for visitors to the upper city. Every tavern up here claims to have invented it. It’s not bad, actually.”
Taking this as permission, Jab wandered over to the bar to watch the drinks get made.</p>

<p>“You need something?” said a gruff, elderly looking dwarf from behind the counter.</p>

<p>“Nope! Just watching,” Jab responded lightly, pointing at his face, which lacked a mouth.</p>

<p>The dwarf grunted in response.</p>

<p>“Fine, just stand back from the bar so you’re not taking a paying patron’s seat.”</p>

<p>From this vantage point, Jab watched the bartender mix several ingredients together — he begrudgingly revealed a few of them to Jab after he prodded, which Jab noted in his journal — before dropping a small token into the bottom of the tall, novelty-shaped glasses. Satisfied, Jab returned to the table.</p>

<p>“What are the tokens in the drinks?” he asked.</p>

<p>“Feather fall tokens,” Snipe responded. “One time use, stops you from plummeting to your death if you stumble off of one of these upper bridges. as many who consume that cocktail are wont to do. It’s almost like a game.” 
“Does it make you fly?”</p>

<p>“Nah, just makes you fall slow enough that you won’t get injured wherever you do end up landing.”</p>

<p>As he considered this, the food Brim had ordered began arriving at the table. A ridiculous mishmash of dishes, local and exotic, hot and cold, enticing and… questionable, were stacked high on their table.</p>

<p>Brim, after another slightly embarrassed look around the table, dove straight in, devouring food at a rate Jab found almost concerning. Snipe, he noticed, also dove in — he tried to make it look more casual, but he ate with the efficiency of someone who didn’t ever know when their next good meal might come. Ven, meanwhile, barely poked at it.</p>

<p>As it neared 10-hour, the tension between them grew, and early conversations — mostly Brim asking questions about Sharn — died down into silence. The food was mostly gone (sovereigns above that girl could eat), their wounds and aches from their battle still calcifying. They needed rest, and this brief moment of silence, before whatever this meeting would bring, was the closest thing they’d had to it all day.</p>

<p>And suddenly, he was standing at their table. He’d approached with an unnerving degree of stealth, especially so given he appeared to be a 90 year old man, with a shock of white hair, combed back over his head, and a quaint but sharp, formal suit adorning him.</p>

<p>“Hello. My master thanks you for agreeing to meet him, and wants to reiterate that it is of the utmost importance, both for your own safety, and for that of this city,” he said in a clipped accent, lowering his voice for the last phrase and prompting the group to lean in.</p>

<p>“I am Alain, and it’s my pleasure to bring you all to a more discrete location. I’m sure you have questions, and I can assure they’ll all be answered soon. I’ve taken care of your tab, so if you’ll follow me?”</p>

<p>The man turned to begin walking through the tavern. Uneasy, but shrugging at each other — this was what they came for — they followed Alain, winding between tables, and down two flights of stairs until they were on the bottom balcony of the tavern. To the side, Jab noticed several skycoach mooring platforms had actually been built under the Lightsbridge, with patrons disembarking directly into the tavern. Clever, he thought.</p>

<p>Moored at one of these platforms was a skycoach unlike any he’d seen so far. Unlike the open-top, boat like coaches, this was a sleek, black, enclosed vessel, with a door and small stairway extending down from it to the platform. Gold inlay filigree danced around its darkened windows, and it had no driver that Jab could see.</p>

<p>“If you please,” Alain said, gesturing to the carriage.</p>

<p>“So, your benefactor is uh, loaded,” Snipe said, as they climbed aboard the carriage. He looked the most visibly uncomfortable Jab had seen him yet. The enclosed space of the coach didn’t seem to be helping.</p>

<p>“Suffice it to say that money is not of concern in organizing this endeavor,” Alain responded, cryptically.</p>

<p>The coach took off, soaring out and above the tavern they’d just patronized. Even the ride was smoother than expected, without the light buffeting and rocking the smaller coach had suffered. Jab felt his altitude sensors rotate and flex, and knew before looking out the window that they were climbing, steeply.</p>

<p>“I thought we were already in the upper city,” he mused, to no one in particular.</p>

<p>“Yeah,” Ven said quietly, looking out her own window and craning her neck upward to look at something he couldn’t see.</p>

<p>“We were. But there’s one part of the city higher than that… the Skyway.”</p>

<p>“Indeed, Ms. Ostler,” Alain said, and Jab noticed that Ven visibly startled before attempting to cover up her surprise. <em>Why is she nervous about her last name?</em> Jab wondered.</p>

<p>“We will be heading to a private residence in Skyway so as to draw the least amount of unwanted attention,” Alain continued.</p>

<hr />

<p>Ven swallowed, hard.* Who were these people?* She was still jarred by Alain’s use of her married name, particularly given that she took that name as a homeless medic travelling through the peasant countryside with a bardic troupe. No one had reason to know that name, if they knew her at all.</p>

<p>And a home in the Skyway? Only the wealthiest of the wealthy — not just of Sharn, but of the continent — could afford property in the floating network of towers that hovered, impossibly, above the city of towers itself. Whoever they were meeting had an immense degree of influence. Ven found herself growing increasingly concerned that she was wrapped up in something much bigger than just House Lyrandar… but being stuck between some other powerful entity and her own house was almost worse than discovering her own house’s shady dealings.</p>

<p>The private skycoach soared ever higher, until the windows went dark, the city lights below hidden behind a shroud of misty clouds. And then they were through, several moons above casting glinting light down onto the glittering mansions of the Skyway. She watched as they circled around the back of one such tower — in all honesty, one of the least garish and gilded of the lot — before coming to rest in a small courtyard.</p>

<p>Alain opened the carriage door, the steps extending down to the ground via some arcane, or perhaps mechanical, mechanism. One by one, the party filed out, and arrayed before a small, innocuous door, prepared for whatever awaited them inside. With a small wave of Alain’s hand, a mechanism within the door clicked pleasantly, and it swung open.</p>

<p>Stepping inside, Ven immediately smelled flames, and as her eyes adjusted, found herself directly in a large, circular library. Books lined the walls of the tower as high as she could see, and a massive, roaring fire filled a fireplace on the opposite wall. A winding, double helix staircase led up the walls to give access to more of the shelves, and the center of the space was arrayed with fine rugs, comfortable sofas, chairs, and tables, with low lights oriented for study.</p>

<p>As they all took in the library, a man stood up from one of the chairs by the fire and turned to face them. Ven felt a wave of recognition and panic flow over her in waves, and she clenched her jaw tight to keep it from falling open. She glanced at her companions, but the rest did not seem to recognize him.</p>

<p>“Hello, all, and thank you for coming,” he began, in a soft, light Brelish accent. “Apologies for all the cloak and dagger, but my involvement in this matter is rather sensitive. Ah, my manners — I’m Merrix d’Cannith. Would you care to introduce yourselves?”</p>

<h1 id="chapter-7">Chapter 7</h1>

<p>Merrix d'Cannith. Patriarch of the Cannith House. Ven couldn’t quite believe it. She hadn’t even seen Esravash, her own matriarch, much less had a one on one meeting with her in a private library. What could the leader of a dragonmarked house possibly want with them?</p>

<p>“It uh, seems like you already know our names,” she responded, haltingly.</p>

<p>Merrix laughed softly.</p>

<p>“Yes, this is true. You have every right to suspicion, and I’m sorry for what I’m sure feels like an intrusion into your private lives. But there is a delicate situation at hand, and I exercised my network to get a handle on any relevant situation as quickly as I could. Please, sit,” he said, gesturing to several of the sofas. ``I have some explaining to do.”</p>

<p>“I’ll stand,” came the quiet call from Snipe. Ven wasn’t surprised. She felt on-edge as well, but forced herself into one of the seats, trying to sit near enough the edge that it didn’t envelop her.</p>

<p>“Right,” Merrix said. “I suppose I should start by telling you that the final passenger on your airship journey was my man. He was there to protect the item that you, unfortunately, saw stolen. He survived, by the way — he was thrown overboard near the end of the scuffle but had enough magic to spare himself a deadly landing in the forest below.</p>

<p>“That was when I first learned of your names, your actions aboard the ship, and the fact that you all — Zoresh, my man, included — were hit by the… effect, of the device you saw. Zoresh sent me a message to warn me of the incoming storm.</p>

<p>“Which, I should say. The device was mine, and I’m terribly sorry for what befell you aboard the ship. I had attempted to avoid such a possibility, by paying the Zephyr’s captain a large sum of money to not take on any passengers during the voyage. Alas, he did not quite recognize the danger of what he was transporting.</p>

<p>“Why…” Ven tried to formulate the question without being offensive. “Why were you bringing such a dangerous thing to Sharn?”</p>

<p>Merrix sighed, and for a moment held his fingertips to the bridge of his nose, putting pressure on what might be a headache.</p>

<p>“It was a risk,” he admitted. “But one I thought I had to make. You see, that device has the power to revolutionize our world. Let me back up, for a moment.</p>

<p>“You all know of the Mourning,” he began, and Ven shivered, the sting of the Mourning’s mists pricking against her skin, the coughing of smoke from flameless fire in her lungs, the sight of her husband slipping into the mists as she was dragged out by his father. The entire nation of Cyre wiped out in hours, to remain shrouded in deadly, aberrant mists seemingly for all time.</p>

<p>“Metrol was not, of course, just the capital of Cyre,” Merrix continued, “but was the true enclave of House Cannith. We lost not only our Patriarch, any many elders of the House that day. We lost our creation forges, and the vast majority of our workshops and the intellectual progress that had been made therein.</p>

<p>At this, he turned to Jab.</p>

<p>“We were… working on things that may have even changed the way those like you live.”</p>

<p>Ven turned aside to Jab to try to clock his reaction, but his metallic, unmoving face revealed nothing. <em>What must it be like to actually meet your creator?</em> She thought. She reckoned she wouldn’t want to. Not like this anyway.</p>

<p>“Alas, after the tragedy struck, rather than come together, House Cannith split at the seams, and now my cousins and I vie for control. That is not of interest to you, but may help explain my actions. You see, the mists of the Mournland are not impassible, not completely. Dangerous, yes. Incredibly so. But those talented and brave enough can survive, at least for a while. And if we could recover anything from our laboratories and forges… it could save our house.”</p>

<p>Ven nodded slowly, putting the pieces together in her head.</p>

<p>Cannith was a house of making, of artificing. They had always had a stranglehold on the efficient production of general goods. And more recently, they were instrumental to the creation of both the Lightning Rail trains and the airships… but while they could build both, they couldn’t operate them. Not without House Orien, or House Lyrandar. Their only invention that required no other house was the Warforged. And now… she glanced at Jab again. Well now, thanks to the Treaty of Thronehold, no new Warforged could be created. That had always seemed right to her before — in a post war world.</p>

<p>It only occurred to Ven at this moment that this meant the Warforged were an endangered — no, dying — species, from the moment of their independence. She felt a pang of regret for not listening to his cheerful pitch about mortality and reproduction more carefully. She was lost in this thought as Snipe spoke up.</p>

<p>“So you sent a team into the Mournland.” It wasn’t a question.</p>

<p>“Teams,” Merrix corrected. “But yes. And those that survived recovered a great many plans and technologies that will keep our house from imploding. But they also discovered something else. What do you all know of dragonshards?”</p>

<p>This time it was Brim who spoke up.</p>

<p>“They’re crystals, right?” she said. “I saw some inky, dark ones in the airship we were on. Those are Khyber shards. And there are two others — Eberron and Siberys. They power arcane things.”</p>

<p>“Very good,” Merrix replied with a smile. “Yes, each shard has its own unique use; Eberron shards for artificing, Khyber shards for binding, Siberys shards for enhancing the powers of dragonmarks.</p>

<p>“As of four years ago, there exists a new type of dragonshard. They were discovered in Cannith labs by my extraction teams. We’ve deemed them Mournshards. Whatever their original type, the Mournland seems to… modify them into something altogether new. I set up a lab, just outside of Starilaskur, and sent some of my best artificers to investigate the properties of these shards.”</p>

<p>Ven almost had to laugh. After years of running from the politics of the dragonmarked houses, it turned out she was poulticing wounds in New Cyre mere leagues from a secret Cannith lab pushing the boundaries of reality.</p>

<p>“It was immediately apparent that these shards contained immense amounts of power. I do not mean this lightly when I say that one device, the size of the prototype you saw, could power all the arcane effects happening in a full district of Sharn.”</p>

<p>Ven couldn’t help but gasp slightly. It took hundreds of magewrights to maintain and power the everbright lanterns, signs, and other arcane processes that kept the city in operation. Could that tiny thing really run all that?</p>

<p>Merrix seemed to read her incredulity.</p>

<p>“I know, an unfathomable thought,” he continued. “But I can assure you, very real. With one problem. No matter what we tried, we could not stabilize the power of the Mournshards. That device was the closest my artificers got, but clearly, it was not enough. It is not yet under control. And there is only one laboratory in the world with the resources, and people, capable of solving this puzzle. And it’s here in Sharn.”</p>

<p>“Ah,” Snipe said, with more impunity than Ven would advise, “so you reckoned that if you could figure out how to safely use the Mournshards, it would ensure you control as Cannith Patriarch, put your cousins in their place, and restore your House to its former glory. And all it would risk is, I don’t know, the lives of a whole district of this city?”</p>

<p>There was a long, echoing silence. Ven clutched her fingers into her arm reflexively. She had no idea what Merrix’s actual magical abilities were, though she’d heard they were extensive. But that barely mattered. The power that radiated from him — of money, of influence — that was enough to make her wince at Snipe’s challenge.</p>

<p>But Merrix only sighed.</p>

<p>“I appreciate your care for this city,” he said. “I care for it too. And bringing in a device that we knew… seemed to somehow cause those near it to express aberrant dragonmarks…”</p>

<p>Ven felt her heart pounding in her ears.* So it’s true,* she thought. You can’t run anymore.* You have a mark now. Just… an awful one.*</p>

<p>“… was absolutely a risk. I could try to defend my choice — try to tell you our lab was deep, deep in the cogs of the city, and well protected, that the risk would be minimal.</p>

<p>``But I won’t. Because reality has proved that claim a falsehood. The device has now been stolen by a dangerous terrorist organization, and I believe they intend to use it to cause great harm to this city. And I believe they will hunt you down as well.</p>

<p>“Wait, what?”</p>

<p>That was Brim breaking in. “How do you know it’s a terrorist group? What do they want with us?”</p>

<p>“Loose ends,” Snipe growled for the second time that day. Merrix nodded with him.</p>

<p>“Yes,” he said. “Did any of you notice aberrant marks, or red-tinged eyes on your attackers? Zoresh indicated as much. It leads me to believe that House Tarkanan is behind this. They’re not a true dragonmarked house — simply a criminal gang that welcomes aberrant marked individuals with open arms and trains them to be assassins and thieves. Somehow, they discovered the nature of what this Mournshard device could do—”</p>

<p>“They named it!” Brim said. “They called it the dragonseye!”</p>

<p>Merrix rubbed the greying hair of his short-trimmed beard.</p>

<p>“Right… even more reason to believe this attack was planned with the full knowledge of what was onboard. And that brings me to why I called you here.”</p>

<p>Merrix looked at them all, one by one. At her turn, Ven felt his piercing gaze, his grey eyes, always ascertaining, calculating, bore into her, and she knew then just how much power — magic or otherwise — he wielded.</p>

<p>“Zoresh broke his leg in the fall from the ship. But he told me that he felt… a pull. A connection to the device, after it went off. And that was how he knew they were heading toward the city.</p>

<p>“He’s stuck out in the King’s wood. It’s going to take him hours, if not days, to arrange transport to Sharn, and his leg needs Jorasco healing. I fear we do not have this sort of time. House Tarkanan could attack at any moment, and if they unleash this device upon the city, the results would be catastrophic.</p>

<p>“You all were similarly affected. If you can get close enough, you might be able to sense the presence of the device. You’re our best hope of getting it back before something truly terrible happens.”</p>

<p>With the ask finally made, a long silence hung over the room, broken only by the continuous crackle of the fire. Ven glanced nervously at the others, and all were exchanging unsure glances.</p>

<p>“How about some whiskey, then?” Merrix said, finally, to break the silence. “I have some fine Lhazaaran vintages here.”</p>

<p>He stood, and walked to a table that was indeed burdened with many bottles of liquor. He poured several glasses, bringing them back to the table where they sat.</p>

<p>“Snipe,” he said, setting them down. “You look like the negotiating type. I recognize I’m in a weak position here. You have little incentive to help me after what I’ve, indirectly, caused you. An appeal to the greater good is lovely, but does not have much moving power in this world. So I offer the following, in both recompense for the suffering I’ve caused you, and for this task I’ve laid out:</p>

<p>“One: lodgings in an apartment in the safest part of Northedge. Yours until the job is complete. Bodyguards at the premises if you wish to have them. Two: compensation in the amount of two thousand galifars upon the recovery of the device, and 50 galifars per person in daily stipend, to grease any wheels or furnish any tasks that need doing along the way. Three: access to any person or place you may personally wish to see in the city, no questions asked.”</p>

<p>At this, Snipe, Brim, and Ven simultaneously reached for their whiskey. Two thousand galifars was a lot of money. Retirement money.</p>

<p>“Do you know of a company called Khorvwares?” Brim asked, seemingly out of the blue.</p>

<p>Merrix thought for a moment, before nodding.</p>

<p>“Yes. Subsidiary of a larger company, not Cannith directly but they pay us for our seal of quality on their products. Mostly household items, basic weapons, et cetera. Why?”</p>

<p>Brim paused before answering, slowly,</p>

<p>“Could you set up a meeting for me with their owner? Whoever runs it.”</p>

<p>Merrix nodded, “Yes, Brim, of course. I’ll not pry, but whatever you may wish to say to… Peter, I believe is his name, I can make such a meeting happen.”</p>

<p>Ven watched Brim nod in satisfaction, curious herself about what the tall blue Firbolg wanted with a goods manufacturing company. It was at this point that Merrix turned his gaze to her.</p>

<p>“Venizia,” he said. “It did not bring me any small trepidation to know you were of House Lyrandar. Our houses have been allies and partners for years, but the situation is, shall we say, ever delicate. I considered carefully whether sharing this information with you, and the leverage you could gain for your house by sharing it with them, was too great a risk. I decided ultimately the safety of the city was more important. I can only ask and trust that you maintain some discretion in this assignment, whether you choose to accept it. Nothing more.”</p>

<p>Ven shrugged.</p>

<p>“I have no vested interest in Lyrandar’s business,” she said.</p>

<p>Merrix gave her an appraising look, but didn’t push any further. Sensing the group’s apprehension, he then excused himself, saying</p>

<p>“I must go retrieve Alain — please, discuss my proposal, and anything you may wish to know or counter propose, in the meantime.”</p>

<p>As Merrix d’Cannith’s footsteps receded into the distance, the group looked at each other with wide eyes. 
“Damn,” said Snipe, softly.</p>

<p>“Damn,” Ven replied in agreement.</p>

<p>The apartment was nice — quiet — tucked away into a corner of Upper Northedge where the neighbors were all very clearly used to asking no questions. They’d refused the offer of security (“What, they’d just be spies for Merrix,” Snipe claimed), and Jab had immediately made off with his first 50 galifars of operating stipend to buy ingredients for food, since the apartment had a kitchen. Alain had handed them each their first installment in small leather pouches, but informed them they’d have to stop by a Kundarak bank each day to retrieve the continuing payments. He provided an account number.</p>

<p>After Jab returned, the four sat at the table of the space’s small dining room, in comparable silence.</p>

<p>“So… I guess we’re hunting this thing down,” said Snipe, after a long moment.</p>

<p>“I guess we are,” Ven replied. Seared into the foreground of her mind was a parting word from Merrix, when he’d pulled her briefly aside during their exit.</p>

<p>``I know what this mark may mean for you,” he’d said. “For all of you, but especially you. I can’t make any promises… but I might know someone who may be able to help you… remove it.”</p>

<p>She could still feel the low throbbing in her shoulder where her new mark was, though she was still resolutely ignoring it.  She was broken from her thoughts as Brim responded to Snipe with a more pragmatic question.</p>

<p>“So, are we starting at the university?” Merrix, for all his information gathering, didn’t know from where House Tarkanan was operating. But he did know of a professor at Morgrave University who often bought and sold illicit artifacts across Sharn’s underbelly, and Merrix reckoned he might have some useful information for them.</p>

<p>Alas, they were forbidden from name dropping Merrix at all — he would provide them money a plenty, but nothing to aid their search that could be traced back to him.</p>

<p>“I think that’s wise,” Ven replied. “Before we go sticking our noses in Daask or other Boromar territory, might as well start somewhere relatively safe.”</p>

<p>“Do you think the university would have any books about the uh, marks we got?” Jab asked, breaking the group’s standing silence on the topic.</p>

<p>“Maybe,” Ven replied quietly. “I’m not sure. I think whatever happened to us was… different than anything that’s ever happened before.”</p>

<p>The silence hung in the air.</p>

<hr />

<p>“It’s so big,” Ven breathed, peering through the railing of an opposing tower at the domed rooftop of Morgrave.</p>

<p>“Sharn holds many treasures,” responded Jaresh. “The houses care mostly about money and jewels — the businesses too — but some of the coolest treasures are kept right  in there.”</p>

<p>Ven took another look before she felt Jaresh’s hand squeeze her shoulder briefly.</p>

<p>“We should get back before mother notices we snuck out.”</p>

<p>It was Jaresh’s third year living with them. Ven was 13, he was… 16? No one was exactly sure. Ven had no idea why her mothers had agreed to foster an orphan from Stormhome, but he bore the Mark of Storms, so she supposed they wanted at least two out of three children to not bring them shame.</p>

<p>Not that Jaresh had any strong inclination to help them with that. Mark or no, the boy was headstrong, rebellious, and had a seemingly insatiable appetite for freedom. None of these were great qualities for a Lyrandar heir. He’d snuck out of the tower during his first week there, and told Ven he made it all the way to the Cogs below the city before Solia’s troops caught up with him. She wasn’t sure she believed it, but he’d certainly shown no trepidation as he’d ruffled her hair, put a finger to his lips, and slipped from the balcony of her room the previous evening.</p>

<p>They made their way back across Upper Menthis to the alley they’d stowed the skycoach they’d nicked from the Lyrandar garages. Jaresh had promised to teach her to fly it, but was still pushing it off. “Soon,” he said. “When you’re a bit older.”</p>

<p>Ven’s hands were shaking slightly as she gripped the gunnel of the skycoach and leaned out into the open air. They were encased in the clouds, and the wind that rushed up to meet them was stinging against her cheeks. Already it had tugged apart her haphazard braid and now her hair whipped about her face in a frenzied halo. She felt a tug around her middle and looked down to see Jaresh holding firmly onto the back of her coat.</p>

<p>“I’m not explaining to their Ladyships how you burned three featherfall tokens and ended up wandering around the Cogs,” he said with a laugh, his other hand resting lazily on the coach’s wheel.</p>

<p>He never did teach her to fly. Two years later, he’d disappeared without a trace. No note, no clue to where he was going. Ven chose to believe he was off in the Lhazaar Principalities, hanging from the side of a sky pirate ship, like the stories he was always dreamily recounting as they snuck around Sharn. As for flying skycoaches, she taught herself.</p>
<h1 id="chapter-8">Chapter 8</h1>

<p>Jab slipped from the apartment before the sun rose. He needed only four hours of dedicated rest per night, and had ensured his companions were fast asleep before he departed. Ven seemed to be in the throes of a minor nightmare.</p>

<p>He wasn’t sure exactly what he was looking for. His mission was… somewhat vague, if he was being honest with himself. As he walked through Northedge, he scanned the pamphlet he’d been given, laden with the best arguments and phrases to rally other warforged to the cause. What was the cause, exactly? That was for the Mothers to know. But Jab had faith it involved the forging of a path to survival, to reproduction, for their species.</p>

<p>He wondered if the Mothers had ever met Merrix d’Cannith, the man in a large way responsible for the creation of the Warforged. He didn’t particularly feel like he owed Merrix anything. Since the war ended, Warforged were free to pursue their own paths. No one exactly knew what to do with them, but he knew for sure that the Treaty of Thronehold’s stance on banning any new Warforged from being made wasn’t fair.</p>

<p>Jab made his way in fits and spurts through the city, latching onto major landmarks and generally making his passage downward toward the lower city. When he’d taken the assignment to go to Sharn, he’d been told about a district called Tavick’s Landing, where travelers tended to arrive and, at least for a while, live.</p>

<p>The lightning rail run by House Orien arrived at Lower Tavick’s, hence its status as a hub for travellers. Even with the massive arcane elevators and wide thoroughfare bridges, it took him the better part of two hours to navigate around to the district. He supposed a skycoach would’ve been faster, but several earnest attempts to flag one down had failed rather miserably.</p>

<p>Lower Tavick’s was as crowded and bustling as the university district in Upper Menthis had been, but the vibe was distinctly different. Those moving through the crowds here had not the excitement of attractions and events, but ranged from threadbare, resolute motions to decrepit, half-shorn dreams. Many carried bottles of some libation or another, and evidently drinking liberally of them was not bad practice within these streets.</p>

<p>Jab took it all in with a quiet fascination, but his interest was in finding other Warforged. He knew many of his kind were making their way to Sharn, one of the few metropolises big enough that one could find stable work even in the face of bigotry. Hoping to snag someone who hadn’t had time to really sink into the city yet, he made his way into the massive rail station. He arrived around dawn, and while the city loomed up behind them, their position at its edge afforded a deluge of sunlight that streamed in through the glass ceilings above.</p>

<p>It didn’t take long scanning the crowd before a metallic glint gave away another Warforged. As Jab approached, he saw a roving pan of their head, recognizing immediately his own procedure for searching. He’d been doing it not a moment before.</p>

<p>“Looking for someone?” he asked, stepping in front of the other Warforged. Jab was just under average height by Warforged standards, but was considerably lithe of construction, lacking the generally heavy-set armor plating and heft that army-bound Warforged had been built with. His specific construction gave him considerably more acrobatic ability, though.</p>

<p>It was a bit challenging to not feel intimidated as the other Warforged — the first he’d truly encountered and spoken to — looked down at him.</p>

<p>“Affirmative,” the warforged responded, a slight tremor sneaking through his deep rumble of a voice. “Would you happen to know the whereabouts of a Warforged named Sabre? He is meant to be in this district.”</p>

<p>Jab didn’t, but he did know that from his handbook that “saying no is the close of any conversation.” So instead, he tried to pivot, putting on a cheery tone and saying</p>

<p>“It’s a huge district, but I’m sure Sabre will turn up – and what is your name?”</p>

<p>The warforged gave him a long, impassive glance before seeming to remember themselves, squaring up their previously hunched shoulders and rising to their full height.</p>

<p>“I go by Lock, designation 4315B, 7th battalion of the Brelish Reds.”</p>

<p>Jab could see a tattered triangular patch of red cloth tied over Lock’s shoulder, with a faded insignia.  The vast majority of his kind, he knew, had served as unwilling soldiers in the war. But the war’s end and sudden freedom had left many Warforged without any direction or purpose. Many, though not all, clung to the identity they held as soldiers.</p>

<p>“Well, Lock, do you desire to learn the secrets of heredity and aging concealed from the warforged race?” Jab asked, trying to segue into his speech. The soldier furrowed his brow.</p>

<p>“I’m… not sure what you mean,” he replied, taking a small step back. Jab felt a thrill sweep through him nonetheless. This was the furthest he’d gotten with anyone!</p>

<p>“Well,” he explained, “You’ve always been told that we as Warforged cannot procreate like those of the fleshy races. But I’m here to tell you that’s not the case!”</p>

<p>“I… I mostly just want to find my friend,” Lock said, uncertain. An idea crossed Jab’s mind, a dangerous one. But perhaps one that would actually work.</p>

<p>“You know, there are many things they say we can’t have,” he continued, trying to keep his voice even. “Like… dragonmarks?”</p>

<p>He tried to gauge Lock’s reaction, but the soldier only stood impassively. After a moment, he responded.</p>

<p>“Affirmative… dragonmarks are inherited.”</p>

<p>Jab glanced around the street, then pulled lightly on Lock’s arm to move them to a niche near the wall of the station. He then pulled up his pant leg to show the mark shimmering on his leg.</p>

<p>“How…”</p>

<p>Jab let his pant leg fall.</p>

<p>“I think we have more to talk about. I have some friends with me in the city. If we help you find your friend Sabre, maybe we can sit down and discuss?”</p>

<p>The Warforged nodded tersely, questions hovering unspoken.</p>

<p>“I am staying at an inn nearby,” he said, handing Jab a slip of paper. “You can find me there.”</p>

<p>Jab hummed all the way back to Northedge.</p>

<hr />

<p>Ven awoke from the nightmare before the sun rose. The neighborhood was quiet, and as she stretched her limbs, she felt the aches and bruises of the day before. She could still just hear the sounds — of flame and mist and screams, fading with the dream.</p>

<p>There was a small note on the kitchen table. Jab, it seemed, had some personal business to attend to. Well, so did she. She added her own addendum to the note, and then, with some trepidation, she made her way through Northedge and over the bridgeways to Upper Central.</p>

<p>Dragon Towers loomed, central to the district, distinctive in their twelve-sided arrangement. She took a quick moment to marvel again at the airship docks floating high above her as she entered Lyrandar tower.</p>

<p>When she was little, everyone in the tower knew who she was. From the doormen to the administrators, Venezia, Mariel, and Jaresh were easily spotted around, causing trouble and mischief. Especially when Solia (Her Ladyship, as Jaresh called her) was away on business.</p>

<p><em>That is, until Mariel’s mark appeared</em>, Ven thought, trying to push down the bitterness. She didn’t care that her sister and brother had marks; every day away from the enclave had convinced her more than anything that the houses, and everything they stood for, was in service to nothing but wealth.</p>

<p>Not helping people. But she still felt the needling, prickling sensation behind her eyes as memories of her mothers’ efforts and frustrations in training her had melted away into complete indifference as soon as a more gifted offspring presented herself. 
Ven wiped her eyes slightly as she approached the front desk of the public entry hall, feeling stupid. <em>I’m not a teenager anymore</em>, she thought. <em>I have a life, a husband. I’m a goddamned adult.</em></p>

<p>Still, being inside the tower again wasn’t helping.</p>

<p>Ven didn’t recognize the individual tasked with directing those who entered the public halls to the appropriate parts of the tower. Evidently, though, her resemblance to her mothers was not unnoticed.</p>

<p>“Ms. Selavir,” the half-elf girl said politely. “Welcome back.” She instinctively moved to correct them — her taken name was Ostler — but then gave up on it with a sigh. Her mother knew, of course, but what good was it doing here.</p>

<p>“Hi, thanks,” she said, shuffling. “Is Mia in?” Mia would know if Solia was in and Ven would rather have her present for the meeting. Or at least give her a pep talk first.</p>

<p>“Unfortunately, both Ms. Toradin and Director Selavir are out on important business this morning,” the half-elf replied, casting her eyes down. “But they anticipated your arrival, and I’m to see that anything you need is provided.”</p>

<p>Ven grimaced and nodded. She felt dirty. Years spent trundling through the Khorvarian countryside on horseback or cart, nights spent in inns, or barns, or under the open sky, hours spent patching up wounds in a refugee camp with scant resources… Ven balked at the idea of being pampered like the House scion they still seemed to see her as.</p>

<p>“Right, uh, I was hoping to access the Lyrandar Library,” she said. It was only a passing chance, but she knew from her childhood sprinting through the stacks that some books on dragonmarks existed. Worth a bit of research when no one was looking.</p>

<p>The half-elf nodded enthusiastically.</p>

<p>“Of course! My name is Elise, by the way. I’d be happy to take you up there at once, and see to anything else you may require.” She waved over to another half-elf dressed in a Lyrandar blue-green kurta to take his place.</p>

<p>“Thanks, Elise,” Ven replied, feeling a pang of guilt shoot through her. Not days ago, she’d never have talked to a servant or staff without asking their name. What was it about this place that brought out the worst in her?</p>

<p>The library within Lyrandar tower was not large, and looked even smaller than she remembered as they entered. Formed of one wall of books that traced the curvature of the tower, followed by two smaller shelves matching the curve progressively inwards, the space had a cozy design. Guess it’s me that’s bigger, she thought, the low level bubbling of nostalgia giving her a slight nauseated sensation.</p>

<p>“Elise, could I please trouble you for a glass of water,” she asked, as politely as possible. Elise scurried out quickly.</p>

<p>Left alone, Ven immediately began scanning for books on dragonmarks. Her eyes searched hopefully for anything on aberrant marks, but she suspected that such a topic would be abhorrent to the sensitivities of anyone working here. The question struck her, then: <em>Had any dragonmarked heir ever manifested an aberrant mark, rather than their houses, before?</em></p>

<p>Following the lead, she grabbed several books gilded with the family crest which promised to provide histories and family trees for their exalted house. Still doubtful — if such a birth had occurred, she’d not be surprised if it was quietly swept under the rug — she began paging through the histories.</p>

<p>As expected, no Lyrandar heir in recent history appeared with any notation of aberrancy. Such a child may well have been killed.</p>

<p>Her search wasn’t entirely fruitless, though. In some of the oldest reaching trees, the impact of the War of the Mark became apparent — Lyrandars marked as died fighting in it, mostly. But it jogged the remembrance of the event in Ven’s mind. Abandoning the family histories, she sought out a general history of the dragonmarked houses that extended back at least 1000 years, and found one with a full chapter on the war.</p>

<p>Some of it she knew — that the young, disorganized dragonmarked houses banded together to fight a set of extremely powerful, dangerous aberrants. They’d banded together under the command of Lord Halas Tarkanan, which she supposed is where this current group was taking its name. He was known as The Earthshaker, and was responsible for bringing down a large part of the city of Sharn during the war. The undercity, Ven knew, was formed of the collapsed towers that had once been Sharn.</p>

<p>New to her were some of the numbers involved — she’d always been told the story as one of coming together, the houses with their helpful, but not hugely powerful marks, coming together to take on a violent monster and his minions. But here, nearly in a footnote, Ven saw that while only a few thousand dragonmarked house heirs with marks existed at the time, more than triple that number of aberrant bearers were killed during the war. Indeed, it seemed they tried to eradicate every last one.</p>

<p>Ven felt another wave of nausea threaten to dislodge the water she’d just gulped down. <em>It was a genocide,</em> she thought.</p>

<p>All of a sudden, the mark on her shoulder seemed to be throbbing painfully, reminding her who she now was. <em>Sure, several extremely powerful sorcerers had committed vast horrors</em>, she thought. * But the thousands of others, manifesting aberrant marks randomly, or by the most common route, parents of two different houses conceiving a child, had no choices to make in the matter. Like I don’t*.</p>

<p>She read the ending of the chapter holding herself as still as possible, but the writing was already on the wall. The houses won, eradicating aberrant marks from the world. They established laws banning inter-house relationships, and used their “defense” of the world from aberrants to vie for even more political and economic power.</p>

<p>Of course, in the intervening centuries, they couldn’t prevent the occasional random manifestation of an aberrant mark. But if Merrix d’Cannith’s speech was anything to go by, those around today had little choice but to join a group tagged as domestic terrorists or be hunted down themselves.</p>

<p>Ven had never intended to reveal her mark to her mother, but suddenly, even the specter of meeting her drove a wedge into her chest. She quietly wrote a note with her Northedge address on it and asked Elise to ensure Mia received it.</p>

<p><em>I’m fine, but can’t be in the tower right now. Please hold off Solia. -V</em></p>

<p>Then she left the tower as quickly as she could, melting back into the comforting bustle of Sharnian streets.</p>

<p>When she returned, she found the others sitting around the table, snacking on various breakfast foods.</p>

<p>“Look what Brim made me this morning!” Jab said, and Ven looked over to see a small mobile forge Brim had somehow constructed on their balcony. She walked over to Jab, and he lifted his pant leg to show a metal plate that fit snugly against his quad, covering his mark. With a flick, he depressed a mechanism which slid the plate up and down. It was fine work — when down, it looked just like a piece of his construction.</p>

<p>“Fine work,” she said.</p>

<p>“Thanks!” Brim responded, beaming. “Are you ok?” she asked after a moment. “You look a little green.”</p>

<p>“Yeah,” Ven replied, unconvincingly. “Are you all ready to go to Morgrave?”</p>
<h1 id="chapter-9">Chapter 9</h1>

<p>The university was mostly a bust. A gorgeous, marbled, gilded, spacious bust, but a bust nonetheless. Professor Olivier Mehton, Antiquities, assured them he knew nothing of Tarkanan whereabouts, and moreover cautioned them to stay as far away as possible from folks like that.</p>

<p>Snipe was absolutely positive that Mehton knew more than he left on, but apparently, they did not meet whatever station was needed to persuade him. As they made their way out of the campus, he noticed Brim looking somewhat dejected.</p>

<p>“Hey, chin up,” he said, perhaps a tad more gruffly than he intended. “No job I’ve ever been hired for has panned out from the first lead.”</p>

<p>Ven grimaced at him from the other side of the group.</p>

<p>“Do we have any other leads, though?” she asked. <em>Fair point. Do you ever crack a smile?</em> ee thought back, but held his tongue.</p>

<p>As they re-entered the bustle of Upper Menthis, Snipe felt a peculiar sensation, one he’d always had, but had honed, carefully, precisely, over the years to keep him alive. A tingle, the hair on his neck raising, goosebumps prickling under his sleeves.</p>

<p>“We’re being followed,” he said.</p>

<p>The rest of the party just looked at him dumbly for a moment, before Jab said,</p>

<p>“Sorry, followed?”</p>

<p>“Yes. I can’t explain it. It’s like… I make a passing note of everyone in the streets. I sense something familiar. Someone from earlier is here again now.”</p>

<p>“And you’re sure that’s related to us?” Ven said, now beginning to look nervously from side to side.</p>

<p>“Yes. And stop swinging your head around, we don’t want them to know they’ve been made.”</p>

<p>“Uh Oh!” said Jab.</p>

<p>Snipe’s eyes darted around to Jab, who was staring off to an alley over their shoulder. Following his eyeline, Snipe turned to see a hooded figure leaned up against the corner of the alley. Watching them. He wasn’t sure if it was a trick of the light, but their eyes almost appeared to smoulder with orange flame.</p>

<p>For a moment that seemed to lock off, stretching unnaturally long, the figure and Jab held eye contact. Then, the eyes darted to Snipes, for a seemingly instant fraction of a second. Then the figure was gone.</p>

<p>“Fuck!” Snipe yelled, “That’s our lead! Let’s go!”</p>

<p>He felt his legs pumping beneath him, powering him forward; he considered shifting, then held back. He could hear the heavy footfalls of Jab next to him. The others would be slower.</p>

<p>Careening into the alley, Snipe clocked the dark shapes littering his path — garbage strewn around, and one large, overflowing crate of it. There was enough room to squeeze around it, but he’d have to slow down.</p>

<p><em>No,</em> he growled, and leaped forward, now shifting, feeling his skin crackle and harden, fur sprouting, muscles seemingly unfurling into existence. With a final leap from all fours, he cleared the top of the crates in time to see their quarry darting to the right down the next street.</p>

<p>Snipe sprinted forward, skidding around the corner and into a wide boulevard that, for the moment, seemed to be hosting a large number of food carts. Sharnians milled about, queueing up to grab their favorite lunches. Ahead of him, the figure was making a beeline for the densest part of the crowd.</p>

<p>In his shifted form, Snipe gained ground quickly. By the time the figure dived into the crowd, he could almost reach out and grab their cloak.</p>

<p>“Hey!” was all the warning he got from a surprised food vendor as a hot wok of frying oil came flying directly at his face. Snipe dived out of the way, leaving an unfortunate bugbear to scream out as the oil caught on their fur.</p>

<p><em>So they’re not afraid to injure. Probably aren’t afraid to kill, either,</em> Snipe thought.* Tread carefully. *</p>

<p>Behind him, he could hear Jab attempting to navigate the crowd as yells and sounds of alarm began spreading through.</p>

<p>Snipe slowed his pace, both to conserve energy, and because the assailant was leaving a path of destruction through the crowd. Easier to focus on avoiding a broken ankle being trampled by the crowd, which was now shifting and roiling unpredictably. He could follow the path.</p>

<p>Emerging from the end of the streetcarts, Snipe’s eyes darted forward until he re-acquired the hooded figure, who was heading into another alley. Snipe redoubled his efforts, grateful for the brief reprieve from outright sprinting. He dived after the figure into the alley, which was a short one, leading to another road.</p>

<p>Snipe skidded to a halt. He had burst out onto a street that wrapped around the exterior of the district. Before him was a railing, followed by a 25 foot chasm before the next tower. Sailing across that gap was the figure, whose hood now flew back to reveal a shock of orange-red hair. They rolled out of a landing on the other side of what Snipe knew would be a fall of hundreds, if not thousands of feet.</p>

<p>He glanced left and right, seeking bridges, and saw that the nearest was around 40 feet up the street.</p>

<p><em>Not close enough,</em> he thought. *Here goes nothing. *</p>

<p>Backing up into the alley, he saw Jab sprinting down toward him.</p>

<p>“We have to jump, long jump!” he screamed as he turned and fell into a sprint next to him.</p>

<p>The two ran forward. Snipe could hear the blood pounding in his ears, and over that, the sounds of hissing and whirring as Jab’s body made mechanical preparations for a long jump.</p>

<p>Then nothing. A brief moment of weightlessness, arms pinwheeling around him for balance, not by any means looking down, and then the ground rushing up to meet him. He ducked and rolled, not as gracefully as he’d have liked, but without serious injury. His shoulder would be sore in the morning.</p>

<p>As they sprinted deeper into the more industrial district, he felt a shiver of something propel him further. Is this rage? He’d never been one to attach himself to any particular job — even a two thousand galifar job. But these fuckers hurt him.</p>

<p><em>There’s answers here.</em> He could feel a small, but alien energy flowing flowing through his veins, the sensation of it heightened by his shifted state. He knew instinctively where it emanated from – his lower calf, where the new dragonmark had emerged from beneath his skin. He resisted the urge to glance behind him, but it felt almost like tendrils of red energy were splashing away from his footfalls, giving him the smallest of boosts with each step.</p>

<p>Alleys turned to streets, and soon they found themselves running down a large, empty corridor. The back end of warehouses lined each side, and the occasional worker glanced up in surprise at their passage. Several steps ahead, Snipe had their target locked in his vision — so much so he almost missed the subtle swipe of their hand as they, passing a horse being attached to a trailer, slit their dagger deep into its flank.</p>

<p>The horse reared in pain, and began a mad sprint directly in his direction. Ducking to the side, he left the problem to Jab, who was taking a more gentle approach; he heard a “Woah there!” from behind him and chuckled internally thinking of the machine-like figure trying to soothe the injured creature.</p>

<p>As the hooded figure peeled off into a warehouse whose gates were open, Snipe chanced a look behind him to evaluate the status of his party. Jab had managed to just barely calm the horse, and the thoroughfare was long enough that he could see Ven and Brim, looking significantly more winded, approaching from the end. They must’ve taken the bridge, Snipe thought. Not UN-wise.</p>

<p>He turned his attention to his task, and cut hard, reverting to all fours momentarily to tack into the open doors of the warehouse… which turned out not to be a warehouse at all, but quickly resolved into what was clearly a mechanical workshop, with 8 bays on either side each with half-deconstructed sky coaches inside. Mechanics were already yelling as, halfway down the centerline of the room, the figure he was chasing was making as much havoc as possible, flinging carts of wrenches and tools, slamming the occasional brave mechanic out of the way.</p>

<p>Snipe calculated some odds and took a risk.</p>

<p>“Sharn Watch!” he yelled. “Stop them!”</p>

<p>Several of the workers in the shop seemed to break out of their slack-jawed observations of the scene to begin moving toward the figure, seemingly buying Snipe’s deception. But it was too late; the figure burst through the other end of the workshop.</p>

<p>“Out of the way!” Snipe cried, perhaps a tad too desperately, as he tried to maintain eye contact with his quarry and was now weaving around the milling bodies of the worker’s he’d just called.</p>

<p>Passing through the open doors, Snipe once moor skidded to a halt, panting. He was in a small lot fenced in to the workshop, and in it, bobbing gently a few feet off the ground, were seemingly-repaired skycoaches, ready to be put back into service.</p>

<p>Except one, which floated closer to 10 feet up, and had a hooded figure at the controls. They spared him one glance, letting him catch those smouldering orange eyes once more, before they yanked the control rod and sent the ship flying up and over the fenced-in lot and out into the inter tower traffic of Sharn.</p>

<p><em>That’s it,</em> he thought. <em>Their one lead, gone.</em> He had no doubt that Tarkanan — who else would be tailing them? — would be keeping a much more careful distance from now on.</p>

<p><em>Dolurrh!</em> He wanted answers, for fuck’s sake. He wanted answers, 2000 galifars — <em>split four ways</em>, he reminded himself grimly — and a stiff drink in his hand on some far off shore.</p>

<p>His mood was collapsing through layer after layer of foul until he felt a tap on his shoulder that broke him free.</p>

<p>“Come on!” panted Ven, pointing at one of the gently bobbing skycoaches. “I can fly these motherfuckers!”</p>

<hr />

<p>Wind screamed past Jab’s face as he clung desperately to the front of the skycoach. They’d quickly left the indignant yelling of the workshop mechanics behind; he was in the front next to Ven, Brim and Snipe had jumped in the back.</p>

<p>The presumed Tarkanan agent was up ahead, winding between bridges and towers, not quite visible, but trackabe through the wake of deflected traffic and thaumaturgic honks and sirens, mirroring the internal alarms and responses Jab’s systems were blaring at the unnatural accelerations his body was undergoing.</p>

<p>Sharn really <em>was</em> an exciting city.</p>

<p>Jab glanced over at Ven, whose brow was furrowed in intensive effort as she attempted to pilot their craft. He thought, despite her general dour demeanor about being in Sharn and interacting with her house, that she might just be enjoying herself.</p>

<p>He wondered what it was like to have the sort of purpose in life that Ven had seemed to so abhor. He felt the reassuring weight of the spear in his hand, generally disguised as a staff, and considered how his own life may have gone if the Last War hadn’t ended just a few years after his creation.</p>

<p>Despite the thrill of the chase, he found his eyes glancing over balconies and bridges as they flew by, seeking out the distinctive metal glint, reflections off of Warforged like him. It was, he reminded himself, why he was here in the first place. His mind flashed to the serene copse of trees within the Eldeen Woods where the Matrons — the leaders of House d’Geneo, though they themselves were not Warforged — had initiated him, given him his mission. He felt a pang of guilt, knowing he hadn’t really made any progress on it yet.</p>

<p>“Jab! Look out!”</p>

<p>The frantic yelp of Ven next to him broke him from his reverie as his mind picked out the two blurs of metal hurling his way. He didn’t even quite see them, but his processors activated a protective protocol anyhow, and his arm instinctively shot out and cleanly grabbed the missile from the air, his head tilting just enough to avoid the other one.</p>

<p>He heard a grunt of pain from behind him, and turned in horror to see a dagger — identical to one in his hand — sticking out of Brim’s shoulder. Where the blade had pierced her, dark tendrils seemed to be pulsing out under Brim’s skin. He cocked his head to the side.</p>

<p>“Looks like poison,” he said, appraising. He examined the one he had caught, and dragging his finger, was able to lift a small sheen of greenish liquid off of it. It seemed to emanate it, though he could see no holes or other means of delivery. He was, thankfully, immune to most poisons… though a strong acid might cause him some issues.</p>

<p>He had little time to ponder further as the skycoach lurched downward, careening into the depths of the towers below.</p>

<p>“They’re diving,” Ven bit out as they dived after, the skycoach shuddering under the forces.</p>

<p>“We’ve got company!” Snipe called from behind them. Jab twisted over his shoulder to see two skycoaches, emblazoned with the colors of the Sharn Watch, amplified bells ringing.</p>

<p><em>Huh,</em> he thought. *Wonder what we’ll say to get out of this one. *</p>

<p>Ven appeared to be trying not to take that chance. They ducked and weaved downward, barely missing the primarily planar traffic flying at various levels. It was mere moments in this dive, but Jab registered the change in brightness, the wider towers blocking more and more of the sunlight as they reached the lower depths of the city.</p>

<p>As they saw a ground — not a true ground, but the roof of a lower city district — rapidly approaching, Ven yanked the control rod, pulling them out of the dive. Jab managed it alright, but the rest of his group seemed to almost squish and deform downward into their seats under the pressure. Brim looked extra queasy, but maybe that was the poison.</p>

<p>Curling around a corner, the clanging of the Sharn Watch still behind them, they came upon a scene of wreckage. An industrial yard had been thoroughly smashed by a high speed collision, and the shards of wood at the end of the crater left no doubt it was the other skycoach.</p>

<p>“Looks like they bailed,” Ven said through gritted teeth. “Time for us to do the same.”</p>

<p>She banked them around, still struggling to control the skyoach at the intense speed it still carried from the dive. They were strafing the perimeter of a tower, which had streets in levels built into its side.</p>

<p>“There’s no way to slow down,” she yelled over her shoulder. “Something broke during the dive! We’ll have to jump!”</p>

<p>Jump? Jab wasn’t sure he’d heard correctly. The street wrapping the tower was flying by them in a blur. How were they supposed to make that?</p>

<p>“The token!” he heard Brim call from behind. Right! The featherfall token from the cocktail.</p>

<p>“It can handle up to 6,” Snipe yelled over the rush of the wind. “Just imagine us slowing down as we jump!”</p>

<p>Ven banked the ship up onto its side, giving them a dizzying view of the street and tower above them, open sky to their left and the ground and deeper chasms still to their right. 
“Now!” Ven called, and pushed the rod down, peeling the ship away from them and out away from the tower. Jab pushed off of the surface, feeling the immediate drop that accompanied, as they all flew in loose, ragged formation toward the street, which hurtled toward them at deadly pace.</p>

<p>And then suddenly, they slowed. Their motion was now a gentle one, down toward the street itself, their horizontal movement also braking at an uncomfortable, but not splattered on the pavement uncomfortable, rate. They landed with four thuds, curses acompanying, before confirming they were all uninjured.</p>

<p>“We gotta move,” came a hurried whisper from Snipe, and they hustled to step into the shadows as soon as they stood. Moments later, the Sharn Watch in their skycoaches whooshed past, bells still clanging. A moment of silence passed, then another. Jab heard his companions let out a long breath. He gazed around the street, but it appeared to be deserted.</p>

<p>“Glad we’re alive!” he said, trying to break the tension. “That was some crazy flying, Ven.”</p>

<p>He watched her carefully for a reaction, and after a moment, she returned an expression that seemed half a smile and half a grimace.</p>

<p>“Thanks,” she said. “I may not have a Lyrandar mark, but I still learned a thing or two, hijacking these things as a kid.”</p>

<p>The silence hung again. It was a distinct, “post-near-death” silence, one that Jab realized had hung over them more than once already. Brim’s laughter, tinged with clear pain from the blade still in her shoulder, finally broke out over the group, and then they were all laughing, releasing the nerves and, at least for Jab, marveling in the ridiculousness of the past day, past hour, past minute. 
“Not to be the buzzkill…” Snipe broke in, as the laugh began subsiding, Brim wiping a tear from her eye. 
“Yeah, yeah, the chase and all that,” Ven replied, “But first, let's get this dagger out of Brim.”</p>
<h1 id="chapter-10">Chapter 10</h1>

<p>For better or worse, they’d crash landed in a bit of a no man’s land, a stretch of tower edge that didn’t really belong to any district. It meant there were fewer prying eyes, but provided few bearings to tack to. Snipe knew they’d overshot where the other skycoach had crashed, so he began leading the group inward and back.</p>

<p>He felt himself falling to the front of the group — he was, after all, the only one of them who’d lived and worked anywhere in the lower city. He glanced at his three companions, all of whom, for various reasons, were walking completely wrong for this part of the city. Ven, too jumpy, always looking around, Jab taking it in like a tourist. Brim… well, her size made her hard to ignore anyways, her near-seven foot frame and wide set shoulders — not to mention blue skin — was not going to be subtle anywhere.</p>

<p>If he was being honest, Snipe felt a little out of his depth as well. It was a testament to Sharn’s size that being from the “lower city” gave him only a passing understanding of how to behave and navigate down here. But he had little knowledge of this district; he was more or less as clueless as the rest of his companions.</p>

<p>Slowly though, the nondescript neighborhood of primarily storage spaces, shoebox apartments, and warehouses gave way to a true district — one he recognized instantly.</p>

<p>“We’re in Downstairs, guys,” he said, pulling his hood up over his head as they emerged from a side street onto a bustling thoroughfare lined with everglow lanterns, taverns, and theaters. Ven, he noticed, followed suit, pulling a pointed hood over her half-elven features.</p>

<p><em>Okay, so we’re in Lower Menthis then</em>, he thought, feeling a bit more at ease triangulating their location within the city.  Downstairs was a rowdy district, but Snipe knew there were some hidden gems tucked away, mostly fine restaurants that required squeezing into a secret back room of a burlesque theater or crowded tavern.</p>

<p>He scanned the crowd, trying to find anyone who looked out of place or nervous — the usual sweep. It would be hard, here, though, as plenty of visitors to the city, particularly poorer visitors, spent time carousing in Downstairs.</p>

<p>He was starting to lose hope when he saw a shock of orange out of the corner of his eye. Darting his gaze toward it, he felt a smile creep across his face. At a streetside food vendor, maybe 200 feet ahead of them, a half-orc woman, with ash gray skin and a braided pleat of vibrant, orange-red hair, was leaning on the counter and, it seemed, haggling for some street meat.</p>

<p><em>Gotcha,</em> he thought. Snipe had tailed his fair share of shady individuals over the years, and was always shocked at how quickly they’d return to their standard routine after thinking they’d shaken a tail. He’d sometimes even deliberately make his presence known, then pull back after the mark’s second or third evasive move, to give them the sense of security. He quickly dragged his group over to the side of the street.</p>

<p>“Got something?” Ven asked, eyes still darting uncomfortably around the neighborhood.</p>

<p>“Yeah, clocked em. Up ahead, 200 feet—DON’T LOOK” he whispered furiously as Brim, Ven, and Jab immediately turned to see.</p>

<p>“People can sense eyes on them, I swear,” he continued, trying to soften his tone. These folks were not used to this game.</p>

<p>“The four of us are going to be way too easy to spot,” he said. “You all should step into a tavern for a minute. I’ll tail them until they end up somewhere, and then come get you. In the meantime, make a plan for what we want to ask them and  how we’re going to subdue them.”</p>

<p>He didn’t wait to hear any arguments, and slipped seamlessly into the foot traffic of the district.</p>

<p>Snipe moved through the crowd like it was water. He moved neither too fast nor too slow, and even occasionally stumbled as if slightly inebriated, though mostly the stumbles only served to help him duck below eye level if his mark happened to be looking around. 
It was, he realized, the first time he’d been truly alone with his thoughts since he’d stepped aboard that ill-fated airship several days ago. It was the first time away from the strange little group he’d found himself in since arriving with Sharn, too.</p>

<p>The piercing thought crossed his mind of simply bailing now. Walk right past his mark, past the district, and disappear into the city, leaving all this nonsense with Dragonmarked houses and assassination cults behind. He worked better alone, anyway.</p>

<p>Their group had come together to survive — and yes, he admitted grudgingly to himself, he wouldn’t have gotten off that airship without them. But did they really need each other anymore?</p>

<p><em>Don’t forget the two thousand galifars,</em> he thought. He knew that would be his next thought, and he tried to shove it away. <em>Come on Snipe,</em> he chided himself. <em>You always said some jobs weren’t worth any amount of money.</em></p>

<p>Two thousand galifars was a lot, though.</p>

<p>As he drifted through Downstairs, he could feel the slight thrill through his body that always came with the work. It was satisfying to do something well. He traced the orange-haired half orc through several short stops, occasionally even overtaking her to break the cadence. At times, he pulled his hood down, at others, he took his coat off entirely. Anything to ensure she noticed no pattern.</p>

<p>He remembered his first jobs — he was his own boss then, just an orphan dodging through streets like these, but he’d already had a knack for pickpocketing hapless tourists. His foster parents were kindly; he never told them about those early exploits. But by the time he revealed that he had made entry to the Deathsgate Guild, he figured they knew anyways.</p>

<p>Soon, the woman with the orange hair made her way into a large, open square. It was crowded, but Snipe elected to hang back, preferring not to be caught out in the open. On the opposite side stood the Diamond Theater, a circular wooden building out of place in the metal and stone of the city, as if it had been dropped into the square from above. Its signage shimmered above the large, multi-door entrance, a glimmering holographic gem that sparkled in the low light.</p>

<p>As Snipe leaned against a lamppost and watched the woman pick her way across the square, he had to admit to himself that, near death experiences and aching body aside, it was a little refreshing to be on a job that might actually give him some personal answers. Money was great, but after a while it got hard to put your heart into a job if a shiftily-passed envelope would be the only resolution.</p>

<p>He didn’t know how much he cared for d’Cannith’s speech about powering the city and terrorist attacks — it all read like a classic “do the right thing” call to action and he very much doubted any head of a dragonmarked house would have a vested interest in the “right thing.” If Merrix was offering them two thousand galifars to recover this device, that meant it was worth much, much more than that. Still, he couldn’t deny that he now bore an actual dragonmark — and not a welcome one. He’d not yet really tried to “use it,” the way regular dragonmarked folk evidently did. It was unclear what, if anything, his mark was useful for. But he knew it held power —  he had felt it thrumming, just in the background, ever since he woke up on the airship.</p>

<p>Snipe broke from his thoughts when he realized he’d lost sight of his mark.</p>

<p><em>Shit,</em> he thought.* Stay with it! *</p>

<p>He climbed up slightly on the lamp post, surveying the crowd near the entrance doors, before catching that orange hair again over to the right, as the figure traced the perimeter of the building. About a quarter of the way around its circumference, she stopped, and vanished into a small door in the side of the venue.</p>

<p><em>Service entrance,</em> Snipe thought. *So she either works at the theater, or the theater is a cover for this group. *</p>

<p>He waited for a few minutes, to see if this was another quick in-and-out stop, and satisfied she was not emerging, returned to retrieve his ragtag party.</p>

<hr />

<p>“Sorry, did he say subdue?” Brim, perhaps naively, had thought her days of tying up prisoners and questioning them had started and ended on the Morning Zephyr.</p>

<p>“Well…” Ven replied, sounding it out and seeming fairly uncomfortable herself, “if this person’s part of the same group as the people who attacked the airship, then we have to assume she has similar capabilities. And would gladly use them on us.”</p>

<p>Brim swallowed, then noticed her throat had dried up considerably. She raised a hand and tried to make a motion to the bartender of the tavern they’d wandered into to indicate she wanted a drink. The burly, tattooed individual behind the bar frowned slightly at her, but seemed to get the message and started pouring her something.</p>

<p>“What did you order?” asked Jab, ever interested in mixology. 
“No idea,” Brim replied. “Whatever he wants me to have, I guess.”</p>

<p>Ven looked deep in thought.</p>

<p>“Something on your mind?” Brim asked. It looked like several things were on her mind, but Ven only nodded her head slowly.</p>

<p>“Sort of,” she said, searching for the words. “I’m a little worried that we’re letting Merrix use us as, well, basically locate-item detectors for the dragonseye… but after what it did to us last time, who's to say it won’t unleash something even worse on us when we get close to it again? What if we trigger it to explode, like Merrix claimed to be trying to avoid?”</p>

<p>Brim nodded. She’d considered that, but was more interested to see Ven evidently admitting — at least, implicitly — that she’d manifested an aberrant dragonmark. Brim had seen her mark of course; Ven’s clothes half burned away aboard the Zephyr and it was visible on her upper back when she’d learned to fly the ship. But it had seemed, for a while at least, that she was refusing to acknowledge it, outwardly attributing her abilities to her fire affinity.</p>

<p>At that thought, Brim felt a pang of pity for the half-elf. She didn’t really know the details of what Ven went through to end up with fire casting and a fiery animal companion, but it struck her that it was possible Ven had been through not just one, but two life-altering traumatic experiences. She made a mental note to handle Ven’s past with some extra care.</p>

<p>It was all a bit much — on the airship, fighting off the attackers, saving each other’s lives… she’d felt every bit their equal, or at least not stopped to think about it. But since arriving in Sharn, she’d gotten the distinct feeling that she was something of a country bumkin dropped into a complicated web of politics and dynastic families and money that she didn’t understand in a way that Ven and Snipe seemed to.</p>

<p>At least Jab seemed out of the loop as well — though it didn’t seem to bother him much. He was a weird one, that fellow. She was just about getting used to the disconcerting way in which he managed to emote without actually having any moving parts on his face.</p>

<p>When she stopped to think about it, just about everything she’d seen, from the airship onward, should’ve completely blown her mind. <em>Maybe it is,</em> she thought, <em>and I’m just too busy worrying about not dying to notice.</em> She felt the exhaustion in her bones, the weariness of what felt like a marathon of activity.</p>

<p>“Well,” Jab said. “I think it’s clear that I should not be responsible for tying this person up, if it comes to that. My efforts last time did not go very well.”</p>

<p>That actually brought a hint of a smile to Ven’s face.</p>

<p>“You know, you tried your best,” she said. “How could you have known he’d be willing to roll off the edge of the ship?”</p>

<p>She sighed.</p>

<p>“When it comes to subduing them, I might have one or two… more arcane methods at my disposal,” she spoke softly, almost regretfully, but Brim’s mind flashed back to the very dangerous looking spells Ven had thrown out in the cargo hold of the airship.</p>

<p>Maybe Ven saw her expression, because she cringed slightly.</p>

<p>“Not like those, hopefully. I mean I can hold a person in place, momentarily, or put them to sleep.”</p>

<p>“Oh, that’s handy,” Jab replied. “My method of putting people to sleep usually involves them forming a large bump on their heads.”</p>

<p>He thunked his spear into his forehead plate to demonstrate. “You fleshy races sure are bruisable.”</p>

<p>“Don’t like that terminology for us at all,” Ven shuddered.</p>

<p>Jab shrugged. “I don’t necessarily like ‘warforged’ as a name either, but sometimes we just don’t get to choose…”</p>

<p>Ven inclined her head to him in acknowledgement, and after a moment, quietly said,</p>

<p>“Yeah. I can definitely relate to feeling like you can’t choose your life.”</p>

<p>Brim took a sip of her drink, feeling it burn down her throat. Her parents would be scandalized, she thought, ruefully. Obsidian had warned her that the outside world would be a bad influence, that she shouldn’t venture so far. Not after what happened to her brother.</p>

<p>But there was nothing to be done. Khorvwares had decimated the business of their small, family forge. Hundreds of years of community had been chipped and etched away by the influx of cheap goods from the company’s new factories near Xandrar. Her father specialized in high quality work. He’d taught Brim how to forge in a way that didn’t permanently destroy the local environment; they weaved elements of nature into and through the pieces they made.</p>

<p>They still got commissions, for fine swords and rapiers, or ceremonial shields. But those were few and far between. The daily traffic of folks from Shavalant had dried up. Her father had even stooped to taking his wares into town and going door to door, facing the townsfolk whose families had been buying their wares for generations.</p>

<p>But mostly they turned him down, shaking their heads sadly. The Last War had brought tough times for everyone, and at least for the moment, wares of her father’s quality were considered a luxury.</p>

<p>Brim laughed into her drink, a single bark that surprised her in its bitterness, when she remembered that her whole purpose of coming to Sharn was to seek out the owner of Khorvwares and ask him to not sell in Shavalant. How far-fetched that thought seemed now. She’d seen enough, just wandering through this city, to know no one would be doing her family any favors.</p>

<p><em>Then again, you met Merrix d’Cannith</em>, she thought. Cannith owns the licensing rights used by Khorvwares. <em>And Merrix promised you a meeting.</em></p>

<p>Maybe, just maybe, if they pulled off this task, recovered the dragonseye, he would force the Khorvwares owner to do the right thing. She wasn’t asking much, she thought. Just leave one town alone. She took another sip, and this time she savored the burn.</p>

<p>When Snipe returned, Brim had a light buzz going. She felt strong, and the light thrum of energy that seemed to pulse through her forearm from her mark felt more alive, somehow. Snipe led them through the winding streets of Downstairs, where Brim, after some coaching, attempted to slump her shoulders and blend herself into the crowd.</p>

<p>It half worked.</p>

<p>When they arrived at the Diamond Theatre, Snipe pulled them all into another tavern, one with a view of the front of the venue.</p>

<p>“I think our best bet is to split up,” he said. Brim felt a wave of nerves rustle through her. “I’ll go in the service door outside, pretending to be staff. I can pick the lock. You all should get tickets and enter through the front, where you’re not likely to be suspected. Someone should check out the interior space and see if anything fishy is going on, while someone else can come to a service door and meet me.”</p>

<p>“How would we know which door?” Brim asked. Snipe rubbed his stubbly chin for a moment.</p>

<p>“Brim, let’s say you’re joining me backstage. After entering the lobby, find any door on the stage-left side of the theater. We’ll be within 120 feet of each other, and I can get you a message to figure out which door you’re at.”</p>

<p>Brim raised an eyebrow.</p>

<p>“Useful trick,” she said. Snipe shot back a decidedly wolfish grin.</p>

<p>Ven, Brim, and Jab peeled off from Snipe and entered the line of theater-goers queuing at the entrance. Dropping a the five-sovereign entry fee into the hands of the burlish bouncers out front, they found themselves stepping into a lobby richly adorned in felts of deep red and blue.</p>

<p>“This is a pretty nice theater for being in the lower city, isn't it?” Brim asked, turning to Ven.</p>

<p>“Sort of,” Ven replied, also looking impressed. “Lower city doesn't automatically mean poor. Some of the most exclusive restaurants are in this district. It's just… closer to the fringes where more dangerous people and groups do their work.”</p>

<p>Peeking through the main doors, Brim could see a large wooden floor where patrons who'd paid the standard fee were beginning to stand, holding spots for their companions off buying ales. Around the perimeter, raised seating was serving more privaledged guests, though many of the seats were still empty.</p>

<p>“I don't see any sign of our friend,” Jab said.</p>

<p>Brim looked around the lobby, her height easily a head above most of the theatergoers.</p>

<p>“Me neither,” she said. “I guess we should try to find a door and wait for Snipe.”</p>

<p>At this point, however, several ushers wearing the theater's sharp, deep blue suits emerged and began corralling the crowd into the theater. Brim looked to Ven, questioning, but Ven could only shrug back as they were shoved into the auditorium with the rest of the guests.</p>

<p>As they staked out a spot near the edge of the crowd, Brim whispered,</p>

<p>“How do we get back out?”</p>

<p>Ven pointed to tunnels leading out the side of the main theater floor.</p>

<p>“I think those might be our ticket. Washrooms maybe? Surely they don't trap people in here for hours with no washrooms, right?”</p>

<p>“Can't relate,” Jab said cheerily.</p>

<p>“Okay, I guess I'll try to go over in a few minutes and see if I can hear him,” Brim said uncertainly. As she did, the lights in the theater dropped, and a cheer went up from the standing crowd as lanterns on the stage burst alight, stringed instruments in a pit to the side beginnng to frenetically bow.</p>

<hr />

<p>Snipe heard the cheer of the crowd faintly through the walls of the theater, and gathered the show was about to start. He'd easily picked the outer door of the theater, but found himself in a well-trafficked backstage hallway that seemed to wrap around the back half of the circular venue. He'd had to duck constantly into storage rooms and behind piles of stage props to avoid being seen, as he lacked the peculiar outfit they wore.</p>

<p><em>I wonder how orangehair got in,</em> he thought, diving frustratingly into a side room as three more staff scurried by. He'd never be able to search the place effectively at this rate.</p>

<p>Looking about in the dim light, he found himself in a costume room, with racks of unused clothing shoved unceremoniously into the corner. He gave them a pass over, and was not immediately thrilled by any of the options, most of which were rather garish and comical.</p>

<p><em>But if it gets me back stage…</em></p>

<p>To his delight, a better option presented itself as he found a crumpled up version of the theater suit in the corner. Trying not to think about how it got there, he quickly changed, and stepped much more confidently out into the main hallway.</p>

<p>His breath caught as the first pair of staff ran by him — a disguise, he knew, wasn't everything, and he was relying on this place having enough regularly rotating staff that he wouldn't be recognized by face as an intruder.</p>

<p>But with the production underway, it appeared all hands were on deck, and everyone he saw was jogging purposefully to their tasks. 
This left him blissfully free to begin peeking in doors, picking locked ones, and overall having his way with the place. He found mostly further storage, along with a few offices. As he wrapped around to nearly the back of the venue, he saw a set of stairs leading downward, to the area under the stage.</p>

<p><em>Interesting</em>, he thought, stepping down.</p>

<p>He made it four steps before he nearly collided into the orange-haired figure bounding up the steps towards him.</p>
<h1 id="chapter-11">Chapter 11</h1>

<p>The two stared at each other on the staircase, frozen in place. Snipe's hand hovered above his rapier, tucked under the suit jacket. He saw the half-orc woman's hands twitching as well, though he couldn't see an obvious weapon.</p>

<p>“We can do this civilly, can't we,” Snipe said, trying to sound casual. “I just want to talk.”</p>

<p>The woman stared at him with smouldering eyes, eyebrow raising slightly.</p>

<p>Snipe took a step back up the stairs, slowly, watching her hands.</p>

<p>“This is a bad place to get in a fight, no?” he said, gesturing to the enclosed, dank staircase around them, hoping to emphasize the upper ground he held. “Why don't we just head up to one of the offices?”</p>

<p>The woman sneered.
“You shouldn't have come here,” she said. “It is your funeral.”</p>

<p><em>Not ideal,</em> Snipe mused. Snipe took another careful step back; the figure below didn't follow, though he thought he noticed a slight glow at her fingertips. <em>Don't like that either,</em> he thought.</p>

<p>Under his breath, he whispered the incantation which should, he hoped, reach Brim if she was near enough.</p>

<p>“Found her,” he muttered with some urgency, attempting not to move his lips in the process. “Back of theater, help needed.”</p>

<p>He saw the woman cock her head slightly to the side, then smile.</p>

<p><em>Shit,</em> he thought, as she seemed to clock what he was doing.</p>

<p>“Naughty boy,” she said. “I guess we can't be civil.”</p>

<p>Snipe didn't wait for whatever came next. He turned and dived upward out of the staircase, feeling the suit on his back singe as a arcing burst of lightning seared across him.</p>

<p>He tumbled into the hallway above, drawing his crossbow from where it hung at his back in the process, and loosed a shot down the stairs. He didn't have time to aim, but the staircase was so narrow that he heard a satisfying grunt as the bolt struck true. He ducked around the corner and drew his rapier, waiting for her next move.</p>

<hr />

<p>“Oh no. Guys, we gotta go!” Brim whispered, hearing Snipe's voice pierce her thoughts. The three had sidled around the edge of the crowd, trying to push through to the side hallway. They were just deciding whether to take turns meandering down when Brim inturrupted.</p>

<p>“It sounds like he's in trouble,” she said, leading them into the passageway. “I don't know how to pick locks, but we have to get through somehow.”</p>

<p>At the end of the hall they saw that this was indeed a washroom, to one side, a single occupancy room, and to the other what appeared to simply be a long stone trough, angled to drain at the other end of the room.</p>

<p>“How civilized,” Ven deadpanned, as Jab looked on at the contraption quizzically.</p>

<p>“Any doors?” Brim asked, looking around desperately. There didn't appear to be any.</p>

<p>“Here,” Jab called. She looked over to see him gesturing at a random spot along the woodpaneled walls of the hallway. “I feel a breeze,” he explained.</p>

<p>The three approached the panel.</p>

<p>“It must be a secret door for the staff,” Ven said. “I don't see any sort of mechanism.”</p>

<p>As she bent over to investigate, Brim raised a booted foot, sized up the door, and kicked at where she imagined a latch to be, sending Ven diving out of the way. The door slammed open with a loud crack, splintering at what was, it turned out, a simple latchkey on the other side.</p>

<p>Ven gave her a betrayed look, but Brim was too focused on the nerves she'd heard come through from Snipe. She figured they were done being sneaky anyhow.</p>

<p>The three ran into the now opened hallway, and Brim led them toward the back of the theater. They ran past a few staff, one of whom noticed them enough to yell in their direction, but then seemingly had no time to follow up.</p>

<p>“We probably have a minute or two before they send someone,” Ven panted as they ran. “Let's try to be gone by then.”</p>

<p>Rounding the curve, Brim began to see the signs of the struggle — charred wood along the hallway, a few hanging tapestries burning away, a crossbow bolt lodged in a wooden beam.</p>

<p>“I think we're in the right place,” Jab said.</p>

<p>The three of them slowed, peeking forward with some trepidation, until a deep, female voice none of them recognized emanated from a room up ahead.</p>

<p>“You see, mercenary, that fighting those of us with the gift is of no use.”</p>

<p>Ven motioned for the group to stay silent, and they creeped forward and peeked inside. There, they found themselves looking at the back of the orange haired half-orc from the streets, looming over Snipe, his back against the far wall. His fur looked singed in places, but he seemed alive. She too appeared worse for wear, one bolt sticking out of her thigh, several cuts along her arms where she'd clearly been slashed at by Snipe's rapier.</p>

<p>Brim moved to step into the room and tackle her, but Ven held her back, shaking her head. Then she stepped out instead, raising her hands and forming a complex sigil in the air. A whispered word into her hands, blown forward, and a ripple of iridescent mist curled toward the woman.</p>

<p>It enveloped her, and they all watched as she swayed, her words beginning to slur, before she thumped to the ground, unconscious.</p>

<p><em>Wow, that's a lot safer than what I was going to do,</em> Brim thought, as the rest of them stepped inside and closed the door of the storeroom behind them.</p>

<p>“About time you showed up,” Snipe said with a growl. But he was grinning, and the growl subsided as his shifted form reverted to normal. “She's alive, right?”</p>

<p>“Of course,” Ven said, looking affronted. “I just put her to sleep.”</p>

<p>“Right right, healer not a fighter,” Snipe laughed. “Keep telling yourself that.”</p>

<p>Ven pouted, but didn't have time to wallow as Jab brought up a more prescient point.</p>

<p>“What do we do with her? I don't think we can stay here…”</p>

<p>The four looked at each other.</p>

<p>“I don't think we have any chance if we let her wake up,” Snipe said. “She did <em>not</em> seem interested in talking on equal terms.”</p>

<p>“What if we just propped her up like she was drunk, and carried her out of here?” Jab said. “You know, like support her on our shoulders, hood down?”</p>

<p>Ven did not seem convinced, but as the moment stretched onward, she said,</p>

<p>“I can't think of a better plan… drunken friend it is.” She reached down and broke off the end of the crossbow bolt in the half-orc's leg. Brim grabbed a long, somewhat silly looking cloak from one of the racks, and they stood her up to drape it over her.</p>

<p>They left the storeroom nervously, Snipe leading them to what he thought was the nearest exterior door. They made it halfway down the hallway to the exit before they heard the faint sounds of the music of from the theater die away, to be replaced by the ever louder-growing sounds of screams.</p>
<h1 id="chapter-12">Chapter 12</h1>

<p>Jab's keen hearing was nearly overwhelmed as the screaming from the auditorium grew louder. The group looked at each other, panicked. They could see the exit door up ahead.</p>

<p>“We have to get her out of here,” Snipe began, before shaking his head sadly.</p>

<p>“We have to help,” Ven whispered. Snipe nodded tersely, and quickly bent down to pick the lock of the nearest door, fumbling as the screaming grew louder still more voices adding to the chorus. The lock finally clicked an agonizing minute later, and they tried to gently place the half-orc down and closed the door behind her.</p>

<p>“I don't know if she'll still be out when we get back,” Ven warned. There was nothing they could do about that now, though.</p>

<p>Jab raced ahead of the group, down the nearest hallway that led inward toward the auditorium. He burst through the door and found himself facing a nightmare. Crimson red undulating light spiraled and curled through the space, moving like at times like tentacles, or perhaps like lightning, through the space, spearing into the hundreds of people packed into the audience. Half of the originally-standing audience appeared to be unconscious on the floor, groaning loudly, the half still standing crying out in some type of agony.</p>

<p>Jab's sensory detectors were highly detailed, his memory highly accurate. He knew precisely the unique color of the light suffusing the theater, felt the thrum of its sound. He'd seen it before.</p>

<p>As the other three in his group stepped up beside him in horror, he heard Ven whisper,</p>

<p>“They used it.”</p>

<p>Jab quickly appraised his companions, and determined that the red light seemed to not be having an affect on any of them. <em>Guess it's a one time thing</em>, he thought, trying to push out the screams. Then a thought occured to him.</p>

<p>“It's here you guys!” he yelled over the screams. “If they used it, it's in this room!”</p>

<p>The statement seemed to jog his companions out of their stupor, and the four of them immediately burst into the auditorium, seeking the source of the light. Stepping gingerly over groaning bodies, Jab scanned the light, trying to find where it was brightest. He tracked the tendrils back and down to the floorboards at his feet.</p>

<p>“The floor!” he called out. “They're under the stage!”</p>

<p>His mind whirred. The stairs they'd seen from the back hallway were too far away. Instead, he leaped over to the stage itself, looking for trap doors that would allow understage access. Not seeing any, he growled in frustration, before taking a running leap off the stage and into the orchestral pit set off to the side.</p>

<p>Dropping 10 feet down into it, he crashed into music stands, tumbling across recently vacated chairs as the orchestral players were also piled on the floor, rolling around clutching at their skin and crying out incoherently.</p>

<p>Jab burst through the door of the pit and with relief found himself in a simple tunnel at the under-stage level. He sprinted down the hall until he found a large opening that led under the floor proper.</p>

<p>The space was dark, lit only by a few everlight lanterns pegged to the wooden support beams that held up the floor above. The ground below was abhorantly sticky, likely with years of ale that had been spilled through the cracks in the floor above. He stepped forward, peering through the darkness — for all his keen sight, darkness was not one of his strengths. But as he moved around the support beams, he saw a red, glowing light up ahead. <em>Got you</em>, he thought.</p>

<p>Following his trail, he heard the others close behind him as he dashed forward toward the light.</p>

<p>Weaving between pillars, he saw that there were four individuals surrounding the dragonseye, which was still pulsing out its red light. A small part of him wondered why it was going for so long — hadn't it been just a split second explosion on the ship?</p>

<p>He'd just leapt a fallen pillar to step within thirty feet of the group when they heard his approach, looking up to see him and the others behind. They immediately grabbed hands, forming a circle. Jab slowed in confusion, until with dismay he saw a glowing arcane circle appear on the ground below them.</p>

<p>“No!” he shouted, leaping forward again, sprinting all out and lunging to tackle one of the four.</p>

<p>His hands passed through empty air and he crashed into the ground, hard. The red light had vanished, the dragonseye gone, along with the four Tarkanan agents. He realized that the dragonseye had a sound — a high pitched whine he almost hadn't registered. In the silence left after, he could only hear the groans of pain from the people above. He lay there for a moment, unwilling to move, as Ven, Brim, and Snipe slowly entered the space where the dragonseye had been.</p>

<p><em>We failed,</em> he thought. He could see it written on his friend's faces.</p>

<hr />

<p>Ven stood with Brim, Snipe, and Jab, supporting the unconscious half-orc leaned up against a wall on the opposite side of the square from the Diamond Theater. They all knew they should leave, but something compelled them to stay and see the aftermath of the attack.</p>

<p>Half of the city square in front of the theater had been cordoned off by the Sharn Watch, who held back an ever-more rowdy crowd trying to push in and see what had happened. A medical triage area had been set up within the cordon, and Jorasco healers were methodically assessing patrons as they exited the theater, some on stretchers, others walking on their own or with help.</p>

<p>Those who seemed shaken but otherwise uninjured were sent to sit on the ground in a large group, blankets over their shoulders, tea being distributed among them. To the other side… Ven shuddered. She knew the subtle signs the healers were leaving when a patient was no longer a patient. She felt guilt wrack her, despite knowing there was little she could've done.</p>

<p><em>How dare he,</em> she thought, her frustration bubbling over. <em>How Dare Merrix make it our responsibility to stop this?</em></p>

<p>“Most people seemed to live,” Brim said quietly as they watched, though even her typical optimistic tone had withered away.</p>

<p>“Yeah,” Ven responded in a shuddering whisper, “Lived to now bear an aberrant mark for which they'll be ostracised or even hunted.”</p>

<p>“It seemed to affect us differently,” Jab said, attempting to put some sense onto it. “We were knocked out in a flash, and none of us were really injured. I noticed it kept putting out its light for a lot longer in there. I wonder why.”</p>

<p>Ven closed her eyes. They were good questions, important ones, but she couldn't bring herself to think about it.</p>

<p>“We should go,” she said. “The watch are starting to fan out and question the crowd.”</p>

<p>The four turned, Brim and Snipe holding up the half-orc and trying half successfully to make her appear at least partially conscious. They walked half a block before Ven hailed a skycoach, praying silently their pilot woudln't ask any questions about their clearly unconscious companion.</p>

<p>True to Sharnian standards, the first skycoach that landed was piloted by a bored looking goblin who looked them all over, said</p>

<p>“You all look like shit,” and took off without another word.</p>

<hr />

<p>The four sat in the apartment with their chairs arrayed in a semicircle around the bound — by Snipe, this time — half-orc. They'd eaten some food and patched up some of Snipe's wounds, but the time was nearing when the woman was liable to wake up on her own.</p>

<p>Snipe didn't give her that chance. He stepped up from his chair and gave her a light smack across the cheek.</p>

<p>Her eyes opened with a start, and she immediately began wriggling against her bindings in panic until she saw Snipe shaking his head at her, looked around at the rest of them, and then narrowed her eyes, but stilled her motion.</p>

<p>“I'm going to take your gag off,” he said, slowly. “We've tied your fingers apart, so you won't be sending of any lightning. If we hear even the start of what sounds like an incantation, you'll be unconscious again in a heartbeat, and we'll have to do this all over again.”</p>

<p>Ven, sitting in her chair to the side, raised a hand, forming the beginnings of the sleeping curse between her fingers. <em>How do we feel about this,</em> she thought to herself. <em>Snipe seems… awfully practiced at this sort of thing.</em> It struck her how very little she knew these people, despite the inevitable bond that had been formed by their experience together.</p>

<p>She shook off the thoughts, focusing on the task at hand.</p>

<p>“When I take this off, we're going to have a conversation,” Snipe was continuing. “A real one this time. We're not going to hurt you. That's <em>your</em> thing, not ours. But we want some answers.</p>

<p>“And you should know that while you're not facing torture here, your choice is to either give us some simple, easy answers and be let free to return to your people, or to be handed over to the Sharn Watch, who I'm sure would be <em>very</em> interested to question you about your affiliations and activities.”</p>

<p>Snipe gestured to her ankle, where they'd discovered the aberrant dragonmark that confirmed the source of her powers and likely Tarkanan affiliation. He then slowly pulled the gag out of her mouth.</p>

<p>The woman grunted and stretched her jaw around for a few moments.</p>

<p>“I feel like a sack of Tella roots,” she said. “What did you do, roll me here end over end?”</p>

<p>Ven heard Jab giggle next to her.</p>

<p>“Something like that,” Snipe said. “What's your name?”</p>

<p>Ven saw the woman debate it, before shrugging and saying,</p>

<p>“My name is Dysentra. People call me Dys.”</p>

<p><em>Alright,</em> Ven thought. <em>Now comes the hard part.</em></p>

<hr />

<p>The group had spent roughly an hour debating what exactly to demand of the agent when they brought her around. Ultimately, they agreed that, like Sbar'in, on the airship, she would likely either lie or be unwilling to say anything incriminating about her group. 
They'd decided to instead try a different tack: demand she set up a meeting for them with her higher-ups, but then track her after releasing her. Ideally she'd lead them straight to Tarkanan HQ. And there… well, they were now highly aware of the high-pitched frequency in the back of their minds that indicated the device was near.</p>

<p><em>Stupid that I didn't notice it at the theater until it was gone,</em> Ven berated herself. But there was nothing to do but try again.</p>

<p>“We want to talk to your bosses,” Snipe said casually. “Do you think you can set up a meeting?”</p>

<p>Ven saw surprise flit across Dysentra's eyes before she raised an eyebrow and, smirking, said</p>

<p>“I don't think Mistress Tarkanan has any need to speak with you.”</p>

<p>Snipe nodded, pacing in front of her.</p>

<p>“Fair enough,” he said. “And maybe I'm wrong. But you seem like a pretty good agent. You were picked for two pretty important missions — on the same day, no less! She may not want to talk to us, but do you think your mistress would be happy about losing an agent such as yourself permanently?”</p>

<p>Dysentra didn't respond.</p>

<p>“Thought not,” Snipe continued. “So, how exactly do you communicate with your bosses? Safe house? Clandestine bar meetings?”</p>

<p>“Ha!” Dysentra barked. “If you think we meet face to face, you underestimate us.”</p>

<p>“Ah, so you use caches around the city,” Snipe mused thoughtfully. “Not bad, though they're a bit succeptible to being stumbled upon.”</p>

<p>Ven thought Dys looked a bit like she'd been slapped. Snipe seized the advantage.</p>

<p>“Your caches must have some type of code or signature to identify them, especially if they're single use,” Snipe said. “What is that symbol?”</p>

<p>Dys was silent for a long time. Ven could almost see her weighing different lies in her head. Finally, she said,</p>

<p>“It's three tallies scratched and a triangle.”</p>

<p>She'd barely finished speaking when a slap echoed through the room. Dys jerked, looking stunned, eyes smarting, as Snipe pulled his hand back. Ven had to stifle a gasp.</p>

<p>“We're not stupid,” Snipe said. You're going to have to try harder than telling us a known Boromar code.</p>

<p>Ven shook her head slightly in amazement. She knew of the Boromar Clan, of course, they were the premier gang in the lower city, owners of gambling houses and brothels and running protection scams on plenty of businesses. How Snipe knew their coded symbols, though…</p>

<p>Her stomach curdled at Snipe's use of violence, though she could see plainly that Dys was more shocked than she was hurt.</p>

<p>“If you're going to lie, think very, very carefully about it,” Snipe warned. “Let's try again. What is the symbol marking the Tarkanan caches?”</p>

<p>This time, Ven could see the panic set in to Dys's eyes. She looked up, then left, then down, seemingly tring to construct something, anything. Snipe raised his hand again.</p>

<p>“It's a red splotch of paint,” she stuttered out before he could move further. Her shoulders sagged.</p>

<p>“So here's the deal, Dysentra,” Snipe said. “We're going to take you to the lower city, and set you free. You're going to go to one of your Tarkanan hidey-holes, and you're gonna leave a message for your superiors from us. We're going to follow you, and we're going to make sure you actually leave the message. We're goint to make sure that the symbol on that cache is exactly what you've said here. If it doesn't match, it's sleepy time for you, and we end up right back here again. And none of us want that.</p>

<p>“We won't follow you after the drop,” he continued. “You simply walk away. You may not trust us on that, but surely you trust yourself to lose us even if we did, knowing exactly what we look like, right?”</p>

<p>They all watched as Dys weighed it in her head.</p>

<p>“All we're asking is for you to deliver our message,” Snipe pushed. “How bad could that be?”</p>

<p>Dysentra sighed.</p>

<p>“Fine,” she said. “You all are the weirdest mercenaries I've ever seen.”</p>

<p>Snipe rolled his eyes as Brim looked immediately offended. He turned to Ven.</p>

<p>“Care to spare us the insults?”</p>

<p>Ven stood, completing the sleep sigil, and blew through her fingers, the mist surrounding Dystentra's head.</p>

<p>“Really?” she said, slightly slurred and muffled through the mist. “I really don't think it's necces—”</p>

<p>The four looked at each other.</p>

<p>“I think that went well!” Jab said, bounding over to the kitchen. “Now who wants to try my attempt at dinner?”</p>
<h1 id="chapter-13">Chapter 13</h1>

<p>Mia Toradin d’Lyrandar walked with some trepidation through the quiet streets of Northedge, awkwardly clutching two bottles of wine in one hand. The other held a small note, with a scribbled address. It had been an exceedingly long day at the tower; the sun had set by the time her skycoach had touched down in the district.</p>

<p><em>Does she really want to talk to Solia’s right hand?</em></p>

<p>She pushed the thought away, glancing around at the variously visible address markers. A job was a job, and Mia was good at hers. Solia had seen fit to let her shadow negotiate nearly the entirety of the most recent contract with Arenal for soarwood, and according to Solia it was the best rates they’d negotiated in years. That didn’t mean she was Solia’s pet, desperately clinging to the severe woman’s coattails. The Toradins owed the Selavirs a debt. Mia’s service had little to do with personal inclination.</p>

<p><em>That’s not how she’ll see it.</em></p>

<p>Mia felt herself sweating slightly, whether from the hilly incline of the streets or her own nerves she wasn’t sure. She found herself wishing she had changed out of the crisp, but uncomfortable Lyrandar uniform before coming here. Actually, doubly so given who she was coming to see. Her steps grew slower as she neared the block that would contain the address she carried, the distance stretching like the gulf of years she had no clue how to bridge. She stepped up to the door and knocked, and immediately heard the scraping sounds of weapons being drawn within.</p>

<p>“Uh, Ven,” she called out, trying to keep her voice steady. “It’s Mia…”</p>

<p>The movement from inside stopped, and the door slowly opened to reveal Ven, suspicion in her narrowed eyes turning to confusion as she confirmed Mia’s identity.</p>

<p>Mia blushed, feeling somewhat sheepish with her bottles of wine. Glancing behind Ven, her strange new companions were gathered around a wooden table, seemingly in the middle of a take out meal… though one of them was, seemingly, working a small forge on their back patio? As the silence extended, Mia realized Ven was waiting for her to say something.</p>

<p>“I got your note at the tower,” she said, looking down. “I didn’t mean to intrude, but I thought since it’s been so long…”</p>

<p>She looked up to see Ven seem to ponder this situation briefly, before a small smile touched her lips, filling Mia with relief.</p>

<p>“I’ll be back in a bit,” she said over her shoulder to the others.</p>

<p>The dark, brooding one still stood hand on his sheathed rapier as Ven closed the door behind her.</p>

<p>“There’s a small park we’ve walked by a few times,” Ven said, gesturing up the street.</p>

<p>The small slice of green lined the residential street along one of the terraces of the district, with benches lining a low wall, offering a panoramic view of the lower terraces and, across the chasm, the central plateau. Mia sat down heavily, her breath puffing out in a small cloud of mist in front of her.</p>

<p>“Long day?” Ven asked, sitting down next to her.</p>

<p>“You have no idea,” she replied, pulling two simple metal cups from her bag. She handed one to Ven, and offered up the bottles for selection. “Both from my father’s estate, I’m afraid,” she said. “I’ve changed much since you last saw me, but not gotten any less of a cheapskate.”</p>

<p>Ven gave a short laugh, seeming to linger on the proffered wines. 
Oh no, she probably doesn’t want any, Mia thought, but eventually Ven selected one and allowed her to pour them into small tankards she’d brought in a shoulder bag. As they sat back, Ven stared out over the city, and seemed years beyond her age.</p>

<p>Mia reached a hand out to a low, bowl-like metal cistern that sat in front of them built into the stone. Waving her fingers, a small bonfire erupted in the bowl. It had a bluish, greenish tinge, with small little crackling bolts of lightning sparking out of it — nearly everything she could do magically was tinted with stormlike energy.</p>

<p>They sat quietly for a while, looking at the city, the gulf of the ten intervening years seeming to grow between them. Ven didn’t know what to say.</p>

<p>“Does Solia know you’re here?”</p>

<p>Mia smiled ruefully.</p>

<p>“No, she’s away right now,” she responded. “Doubtless if I’d told her, she’d have tried to turn me into a spy… You are going to have to see her though.”</p>

<p>“I know,” Ven said, quietly.</p>

<p>More silence followed, passing before them as if dragging behind the skycoaches that flitted across the skyline before them.</p>

<p>“I know you think that no one cared about you or noticed when you left,” Mia said, the words suddenly spilling out like an open tap, “but it’s not true. It was like a hole had been punched in the side of the tower. All of the staff felt it. Mariel felt it. I felt it. And I know you won’t believe it, but your mother felt it too.”</p>

<p>Ven stared out at the city.</p>

<p>“I’m sure she had an interesting way of showing it,” she said.</p>

<p>Mia sighed.</p>

<p>“Believe it or not, it was about the first time her actions weren’t inscrutable,” Mia replied. “For weeks, she stormed about the tower, ranting and raving and threatening to send a battalion to get you back. After Jaresh, I don’t think she could bear to lose another. And then she went silent. Kept to her rooms for weeks on end. I… basically ran the tower for a while.”</p>

<p>Mia scanned Ven’s face for a response, but she, like her mother, was characteristically stone faced.</p>

<p>“She knew where you were, though. Always,” Mia continued. “She uh… she had informants tracking you across the continent. She didn’t interfere because she thought you just wanted to forget it all.”</p>

<p>Mia was surprised to find her face growing a bit wet, a sheen over her eyes blurring the everlight lanterns dotting the city before them into a streaky abstraction. She felt a soft touch on her arm, and blushed again as she saw Ven reaching out to comfort her, for all intents seeming more like the older of the two, though Mia was several years her senior.</p>

<p>“I’m sorry, Mia,” she said. “I did need to go. And I don’t care about, or even support, most of what the family does. And I especially couldn’t go down the path Solia had set out for me. But it was still selfish. I left good things behind, too.”</p>

<p>Mia nodded and took a sip, finishing her tankard. She poured more. 
“You were a good  babysitter,” Ven said, and Mia laughed, the sound ringing around the park. It felt good to laugh.</p>

<p>“Yeah, I almost forgot. You were a nightmare,” she said through the last giggles, before growing thoughtful again. “You know, I was happy you got away. I was sad, but you were so terribly unhappy here. I think Solia may actually have realized, after you left, that for all her attempts to carve a world for you and your sister to inherit, she forgot to… you know, actually raise you. Actually see if you wanted it. I’m not asking you to forgive her. But she’s not the same woman anymore.”</p>

<p>Ven took a deep breath, and a tentative sip of the wine she’d been nursing.</p>

<p>“Do you know why she sent for me?” she asked suddenly. “If what you’re saying is true, I can’t imagine she’d send vague threats and summons just to get me to watch Mariel’s trial.”</p>

<p>“You’re right. It’s definitely not that,” Mia said. “ In fact, I doubt she’ll even ask you to attend, if you don’t wish to. But I don’t know what she needs from you. And I know everything, so if she didn’t tell me, then it’s highly classified. Ven, I promise you, she wouldn’t make contact if it weren’t critical.”</p>

<p>“Hmm.”</p>

<p>Mia knew that sound. It was the sound Ven had always made when she knew she was trapped into something she didn’t want to do. Mia’s heart ached to see the woman so torn up inside. She’d read bits and pieces in the reports, the horrible fire, Ven trapped so close to the Mourning… she shivered. She had no clue what exactly Ven had been through, but she could see in her eyes that she’d lost more than Mia could imagine. She reached into her bag, looking for something to cheer her up, and pulled out a stack of envelopes.</p>

<p>“Alyse wrote you letters,” she said. “We have a stack of them in the tower, which you can take any time, of course. Solia and her fought about it all the time; Solia was bitter, but wanted to respect your privacy. Anyways, this is one of the newer ones. Just thought I’d offer it.”</p>

<p>Ven took the letter, emblazoned with her mother’s seal, and its characteristically off-kilter stamping that resembled the attempt of a toddler in a hurry. She slipped it into her sleeve.</p>

<p>Mia knew that Ven's relationship with Alyse was nearly as complicated as that with Solia. She thought it was less overtly negative, but you never knew with Ven. Alyse was something of a free spirit — she'd spent most of Ven's childhood at sea, commanding part of the Lyrandar Southern Fleet. Mia had actually served under her, for a few years.</p>

<p>Those were fond memories. Alyse was the type of woman to throw herself into the see from the sails if the day was nice enough. Mia wondered, if Ven ever took a moment to relax, if she'd be anything like her mother.</p>

<p>“She'll be there, at the ceremony,” Mia ventured. Ven nodded, but didn't seem to register much. Something seemed… different about her. Not just the time past. There was a certain roiling energy about her. Vibrating just under the surface. As she examined her once-friend, who sat with hands curled into fists at her side, her small fox darted out from under the bench and lept into the cistern holding her Bonfire.</p>

<p>“Ven!” She called out instinctively, standing up and preparing a spell to put out the flames. But Ven only laughed, as the fox seemed to burst into its own orange flames, curling up in the blue-green fire.</p>

<p>“Okay… odd,” Mia said, siting back down.</p>

<p>“I know,” Ven replied. “I don't really understand it either. I thought I was going crazy for a little while, but as near I can tell, it's some type of familiar that's bonded to me.”</p>

<p>“It — they? — are cute,” Mia said.</p>

<p>“I decided it's a she,” Ven said, “and I'm pretty sure my deciding actually made it so. I think I might call her Cinder.”</p>

<p>The two watched as the fox perk its head up, wreathed with in the flames, and cocked it to the side. It seemed to glow a little brighter.</p>

<p>“I think she likes it,” Mia said.</p>

<p>She paused, trying to pick her words carefully.</p>

<p>“I don't know exactly what you're wrapped up in here, with those strange friends of yours,” she began, “and I'm not going to pry. But be safe, okay? This city always has its dangers, but things seem especially tense at the moment. I'm assuming you heard about the attack at the Diamond Theater?”</p>

<p>Ven sighed.</p>

<p>“Yeah,” she said. “… I'll try to be careful.”</p>

<p>“Good,” Mia replied. “I'd hate to see something like that happen to you.”</p>

<p>Ven seemed poised to say something else in response, then seemed to hold it back.</p>

<p>“The Houses are growing too powerful, Mia,” she said instead.</p>

<p>Mia frowned. It was a stance Ven had long held, one they'd discussed actively during their youth. She wasn't sure why Ven wanted to rehash it now. They'd never quite come to an agreement. At the same time, Mia now had a decade of experience rising through the ranks of House Lyrandar.</p>

<p>“… Maybe,” she ventured, cautiously, “I can see that some of the Houses, like Cannith, or Orien, or” — she winced slightly — “or Lyrandar, could be seen as holding too much sway in the politics of the five nations. But what of, say, House Jorasco? or Ghallanda? Do we not need hospitals or inns and taverns?”</p>

<p>“I'm not arguing that Dragonmarks are inherently evil,” Ven said tightly. “But if anything, House Jorasco is the <em>worst</em> of them. Imagine having the supernatural ability to heal others' ailments and to wield that power only for the highest bidders.”</p>

<p><em>They</em> do <em>have some free public healing houses,</em> Mia thought defensively, but she had to admit that Ven's larger point wasn't without merit.</p>

<p>“Healers need to eat too, Ven,” she said. “I see where your concern lies, truly, but I don't think there's anything wrong with charging at least those who can afford it for your services. It would be great to give it away for free, as you did in New Cyre… but not everyone has the privilege to do that.”</p>

<p>She regretted the words as soon as they'd left her mouth. Ven stiffened across from her, face darkening. <em>Shit, I've fucked this up. Again.</em> she thought. <em>She didn't even know Solia's hand was pulling strings to keep her afloat.</em></p>

<p>After a long silence, Ven finally spoke again, the words barely a whisper.</p>

<p>“So it's true, then,” she murmured, her words like ice. “I never really left Solia's grip at all. The mystery donations that kept the clinic running… the uncharacteristically stockpiled medical supplies… She was there the whole time. Letting me live out my little fantasy, until the moment she felt I'd had enough. And then, all it took was a threat to take it all away for me to come slinking back.”</p>

<p>Mia felt tears breaking at the edges of her eyes. She longed to reach out, to try to comfort Ven, but she knew she'd only be shrugged off, and that would hurt even more. She wished fervently that she could explain that it wasn't really like that… that Solia had realized she'd lost a daughter, and just wanted to make sure she could achieve her goals.</p>

<p>It wouldn't matter. Even with that intention, her interference, her unwillingness to let Ven truly leave her sight, to forge her own path… That's what Ven couldn't stand. And Mia had stood by and watched it happen for all those years.</p>

<p>Mia stood suddenly.</p>

<p>“I'm sorry,” she said. “I should go.” She turned toward the city, away from Ven, gathering her cups and the now empty wine bottles in embarrassment, hiding her use of her sleeve to wipe her eyes.</p>

<p>“Wait,” Ven said. Mia turned back, slowly. Ven patted the bench, shooting her a tired smile. “Sit down. It wasn't your fault, and I'm not about to rope the one true friend and confidante I had besides Jaresh in this blasted city into my web of animosity. I hope I can disagree with the House's motives and resent my mother for her actions without driving you away, too.”</p>

<p>Mia sat back down, slowly, the guilt still roiling in the pit of her stomach. <em>You can never tell her,</em> she thought.</p>

<hr />

<p>The two sat until the fire died out, exchanging a few more words. Ven reluctantly diverged a few details of her life as a healer in New Cyre, her travels with a bardic troop across Khorvaire. Mia relayed a bit about her time at sea — though not the raunchiest bits — and found herself venting uncharacteristically about her recent attempts to juggle multiple simultaneous contract negotiations with Cannith, Aranel, and the Zil gnomes, all of whom had essential contributions needed for the construction of an airship.</p>

<p>Ven, to her credit, nodded along and laughed at the right bits… but it soon became clear that her thoughts were churning somewhere Mia simply couldn't access.</p>

<p>As they stood to leave, the bonfire burned down to cinders, Mia instinctively embraced Ven as she always used to. She felt her old friend tense up, before seeming to melt into the hug. She felt thinner than Mia remembered.</p>

<p>“Thanks,” Ven said. “It's… been a while since I've seen a friendly face.”</p>

<p>“You may not see Sharn as a home, but you're always going to be family to me,” Mia said, trying to project, somehow, how she felt. She felt her face growing red again. “If you want me, of course.”</p>

<p>The implication seemed to strike Ven as she winced slightly. Her face softened, and she put a hand on Mia's shoulder as Cinder jumped onto her own.</p>

<p>“Of course, Mia,” she said quietly. “I'll… see you soon.”</p>

<p>Ven turned and walked away through the park, back toward her apartment and that strange crew of hers. Mia almost regretted not asking how she came to travel with them, but something told her she'd get very little in response.</p>
<h1 id="chapter-14">Chapter 14</h1>

<p>Morning came all too quickly. Snipe was still sore from the chase the day before, not to mention the lightning strikes he bore, and it was frustratingly challenging to rest with a Tarkanan agent bound in their living room. He kept waking up and checking, execting to see the figure looming over his bed with daggers raised.</p>

<p>He had to keep reminding himself that Jab, in another feat of his engineering, didn't actually <em>need</em> sleep. He needed to rest, but had offered to post up in the living room watching their prisoner throughout the night for any signs of an escape attempt.</p>

<p>He still had reservations about their plans. Dysentra was, if nothing else, some form of leverage, and he hated giving her up without more certainty that she wasn't leading them into a trap, or simply a random alley. He had to hope that his forcing of the symbol first meant that if she was lying, she wouldn't be able to even <em>find</em> a spot “marked by a red splotch of paint.” At leas then they could knock her out again and try something else.</p>

<p><em>That spell sure is useful</em>, he mused, feeling a pang of envy at Ven's ability. He normally had no interest in magic — he'd always seen it as a fickle art, and he'd take a dagger and rapier in hand for a fight over trusting he could somehow draw the right energy from the weave in a split second. But he had to admit… sending a target to sleep would be <em>extremely</em> useful in his line of work.</p>

<p>The thought gave him pause. He hadn't even been to the Deathsgate guildhouse since arriving back in the city. He was owed payment for a job.</p>

<p><em>Yeah, like two-hundred galifars,</em> he thought, then immediately chided himself. Gold was gold.</p>

<p>Dysentra, who they had un-blindfolded once they were far enough from the apartment, was leading them through the <em>Precarious</em> district of Lower Dura. She was about a block ahead, but to her credit, seemed to be holding true to her word to not bolt.</p>

<p>On all sides, massive warehouses loomed, the arched ceilings of the tower's center high above. Lower Dura was the district adjacent to the massive lifts which brought goods up the cliffside from the Dagger River hundreds of feet below, and was the primary waystation for those goods before they made their way into the city.</p>

<p>Dys, however, soon cut inward away from the district's edge, leading inward toward the set of bridges that connected Lower Dura to the rest of the city.</p>

<p><em>Callestan</em>, Snipe shivered. He'd heard the stories about Callestan. A forlorn district, half rubble, torn to shreds by turf wars between the Boromar Clan and the Daask. Sharn's tawdiest stores, seediest brothels, and most questionable taverns could be found here.</p>

<p>At this time of the midmorning — though it was hard to know the time given the district's location deep within the Dura tower — Callestan was quiet. The group passed several individuals passed out at the edges of the street, one even hung out a tavern window.</p>

<p><em>Sleeping, or dead?</em> Snipe thought. It was hard to tell.</p>

<p>He perked up as he caught a subtle hand sign from Dys up ahead. He motioned the group, and they slowed. Slipping forward, he watched as Dys turned into a side alley. Keeping to the opposite side of the street, Snipe stole ahead, pretending to walk past, but glanced into the alley long enough to see the half-orc pull a brick from the wall, slip their note in, and place it back in.</p>

<p>She spared him one last withering glance from the alley, then faded down it, into the darkness.</p>

<p>Snipe took a lingering, roundabout path toward the alley, slipping between the crowds that passed through the streets, before stepping carefully into the alley. He hadn't noticed anyone watching him, but you could never be too sure.</p>

<p>Peering across the bricks of the wall, he confirmed the symbol on the brick was indeed three small red spots, easily missed as a stray splatter of paint.</p>

<p>Returning to the group, he whispered,</p>

<p>“Seems she wasn't lying. She put the note behind a false brick in the alley wall, and the symbol was as she described.”</p>

<p>“So… now what?” Brim asked, glancing about their decrepit surroundings.</p>

<p>“Unfortunately,” Snipe said, “I think now we wait. There's a tavern across the street from the alley. I suggest we hole up there by a window and hope someone comes to collect this note.”</p>

<p>“Are we… you know, safe here?” Ven asked.</p>

<p>Snipe shrugged.</p>

<p>“As safe as we could be in Callestan,” he replied. “I think we're relatively safe if we stick together as a group, and at this time of morning, everyone's sleeping off the night.”</p>

<hr />

<p>It was the the single dirtiest room Brim had ever seen. A layer of dark grime, speckled with some type of soot, coated everything — which wasn't much. The tavern, if you could call it that, was about ten feet wide, extending back into the building around forty feet.</p>

<p>Five of that ten-foot width was taken up by the bar stretching down the righthand side, which seemed to be formed of multiple panels of driftwood nailed together. There were no chairs along the bar — there wasn't room for any — but at the very front, three small tables had been shoved into the corner.</p>

<p>There didn't appear to be a tavern keeper, nor, at the moment, any other patrons, save an individual crumpled against the back wall. As Ven, cringing, took a seat at the small table, Brim walked up to bar and jumped back as a figure popped up in front of her.</p>

<p>The halfling was bald, with a cutoff vest and leather pants, and had strange, twisting tattoos running up both arms. He eyed her suspiciously.</p>

<p>“You ain't from here,” he said curtly, his lower city drawl somehow clipped yet drawn out simultaneously. “Locals only establishment.”</p>

<p>Brim felt her face turn purple and nearly turned to direct her friends out, but then felt Jab step up to the bar next to her.</p>

<p>“Now, good sir,” he said in his metallic lilt. “You don't seem to have a lot of customers at this time, vying for space. Surely you'd take the sovereigns of a few weary travellers?”</p>

<p>The halfling turned his peircing gaze on Jab, staring him down for a few seconds. Jab's face, as usual, bore no response.</p>

<p>“Thrice dammned,” the halfling said finally. “Guess you gotta point. Never did trust you rusties though. I don't trust a man I can't get drunk with. That's when a man shows their true colors.”</p>

<p><em>Rusties?</em> Brim thought. <em>Are there pejorative terms for warforged</em>?</p>

<p>Jab, meanwhile, set his elbows upon the bar — then, testing his weight and seeming unconvinced at the structure's stability, lifted them back up.</p>

<p>“Did it ever occur to you,” Jab paused dramatically, and the halfling finally grunted and said,</p>

<p>“…Lotar.”</p>

<p>“Did it ever occur to you, Lotar, that we warforged wish we could eat and drink like you fleshy races? It's awfully boring to sit in taverns and restaurants and walk past street carts and never get to partake. But I promise to show you the real me anyway!”</p>

<p>Lotar squinted, twisting his mouth around as he thought.</p>

<p>“Hehm,” he said gruffly, though his face has softened. “Never thought of it that way. Fine. You're all welcome. Though I still don't like mosta you, on accounting mosta you not having your well-displayed charm.”</p>

<p>“How many other warforged <em>do</em> come in here?” Jab asked with seemingly genuine curiosity.</p>

<p>“Erhm, well, guess you'd be the first.”</p>

<p>Jab, seemingly content he'd nailed the argument, sauntered back to their tiny table and joined the others.</p>

<p>Brim got their drinks — “I got cheap shit, and cheap swill,” Lotar panned — and returned as well.</p>

<p>“Where did you get so good at talking to people?” Brim asked in awe as she sat back down. “I thought that man was going to kick us out…”</p>

<p>“He could hardly kick us out,” Snipe broke in. “He's about the size of your calf, Brim.”</p>

<p>Ven rolled her eyes.</p>

<p>“Did you see those tattoos, Snipe? We're one-hundred percent in a Boromar den right now. There's fifty more where Lotar came from hiding in the shadows, and they've all got clubs and machetes.”</p>

<p>“Well,” said Jab, ignoring the interruptions, “As you all know, I'm kind of on a mission. There's these Mothers, see, and they're trying to help us warforged — the ones in House Geneo — unlock the secrets of heredity. But they, well, I guess we, need more of us in the house first?”</p>

<p>He seemed to stumble over his thoughts momentarily, before continuing,</p>

<p>“Anyways, they gave me the literature I've shown you all,” — he held up a pamphlet from his pack — “and some of the others in House Geneo taught me a bit about how to bring others in!”</p>

<p>The three sat a bit awkwardly. They'd not quite faced the cult-y — or at least, questionable — structure of Jab's community since he first met them aboard the <em>Morning Zephyr</em>.</p>

<p>After a quiet pause, Brim ventured,</p>

<p>“So, how many warforged have you gotten to sign up for House Geneo?”</p>

<p>Jab slinked sheepishly in his chair.</p>

<p>“Technically… none,” he began, “Though, I mean, I was coming to Sharn for that purpose and we've all been a bit occupied since getting here…”</p>

<p>As the rest nodded reassuringly, he perked up suddenly.</p>

<p>“Oh and wait! I have one partial convert! I didn't even tell you. I met a warforged named Lock down in the Terminus district the morning I went out. He uh, well, actually, he needs our help tracking down his friend Sabre….”</p>

<p>“Wait, what?” said Ven.</p>

<p>“Well, it's just that I could feel Lock wanted to join, but he was worried about his friend,” Jab said. “Sabre was supposed to meet Lock when Lock arrived in the city, but he never showed. I asked around a bit and didn't learn anything about Sabre, but I did hear from a couple of people in the district that there were rumors spreading about warforged not showing up for their warehouse shifts, and going missing entirely…”</p>

<p>“That's horrible!” Brim said.</p>

<p>“Yeah, agreed,” Ven added, “but wait, did you say you offered our help tracking this Sabre down??”</p>

<p>Jab looked around defensively.</p>

<p>“No! I mean, not exactly… I just, well, I said that I <em>might</em> be able to help, and at the time I thought that maybe it was connected somehow to what we're looking into, or maybe we'd be investigating in the same areas anyways.”</p>

<p>“I mean, if something is happening to all the warforged, I think we should help Jab look into it,” Brim said. “Maybe after dealing with this dragonseye thing, though…”</p>

<p>Ven nodded. “Speaking of…”</p>

<p>Brim jumped, realizing their conversation had distracted her from their task of watching the alley.</p>

<p>“Don't worry…” Snipe said quietly, having sat mostly in silence with his head tilted over toward the window. “No one's come by yet.”</p>

<p>Heads now centered on the task at hand, the group settled in to watch.</p>

<p>An hour went by. Then two. By the third, Brim had grown sleepy, and had to down another burning, bitter drink to keep herself awake. By the fourth, the streets had filled out, and Lotar's tavern had begun filling up as well.</p>

<p>She soon found herself drawn to the conversations of the incoming patrons, most of whom carried the same grime as the establishment. They all had a nervous energy about them, and many carried copies of the Sharn Inquisitor, which appeared to be one of the city's newspapers. Some also clutched what appeared to be some type of red flyer.</p>

<p>Brim snagged a dropped or abandoned copy of the newspaper off the ground and began to read.</p>

<p>“Wow, uh, guys, you should listen to this,” she said. “It says that more than three hundred people at the Diamond theater manifested aberrant dragonmarks after the attack. Lots of people were injured or knocked unconscious… three died, but they were sick or elderly, it says. But that's not the thing. Here,” she pointed to the second heading on the first page.</p>

<p>“'House Tarkanan takes responsibility for the attacks,'” she read aloud. “'Further stoking the incendiary flames, thousands of flyers rained down into the lower city over night, with an open call from Tarkanan.' … It says the flyers are offering people the <em>opportunity</em> to come be converted, to get a dragonmark like those at the theater. They say Tarkanan will teach people how to use their marks, and stop letting the wealthy elite of the upper city push them around…”</p>

<p>She looked up, to see Ven pale as a ghost across the table. Snipe stroked his chin appreciatively and let out a low whistle.</p>

<p>“So diamond wasn't an attack, <em>per se</em>,” he said. “It was… more of an advertisement. Proof that they could do it, proof that couldn't be covered up by the Sharn Watch…”</p>

<p>“Why would anyone <em>want</em> an abberant dragonmark,” Ven whispered, aghast. “Don't they know about the War of the Mark? About how dangerous aberrant marks are?”</p>

<p>Jab leaned in even closer.</p>

<p>“I mean, they haven't hurt <em>us</em> yet,” he began, but the panicked widening of Ven's eyes shut him up.</p>

<p>Snipe shook his head.</p>

<p>“I think people know that dragonmarks, whatever the kind, represent power,” he said. “Sure, those with aberrant marks have been persecuted against. But that's in part because there's so few of them. Maybe these Tarkanan people think that if enough people show up and manifest these marks, they'll have to be reckoned with as equals…”</p>

<p>“Yeah,” Ven said, hollow, “Especially since aberrant marks often come with horrific, twisted powers.”</p>

<p>Brim frowned. Ven seemed to have very strong opinions about aberrant marks, but Brim had never felt her mark's power infecting her thoughts, or representing anything “twisted and horrific.” In fact, the only thing she'd really used it to do so far was repair an arcane engine. <em>And Onatar wouldn't give you the choice to take on something evil, right?</em> She felt sure he wouldn't.</p>

<p>As Brim looked up and around, seeking a copy of the red flyer to peruse, she noticed that the bar had grown packed with workers, all throwing back drinks and discussing the same topics as their table, albeit in drunk, loud, animated fashion.</p>

<p>“Exactly!” yelled a warehouse worker. “There aint been a population of aberrant bearers in a thousand years. I bet they only call <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">em that to make </code>em sound scary! They just wanna keep the power from us!”</p>

<p>“Sure!” said another, pointing an accusing finger upward, “but you can bet your ass to Khyber that if we show up for this `conversion,' the Sharn Watch will be there to round us up and throw us in prison for a week before we ever get a taste of a dragonmark.”</p>

<p>That sent a murmer of agreement through the crowd, but the first worker wasn't backing down.</p>

<p>“Look outside! There's already hundreds of people marching to the warehouses! The Watch may mobilize, they may try to shut us down, but they can't round up every soul in the lower city! Our safety is in numbers!”</p>

<p>This also generated a chorus of agreement from part of the room, and as Brim glanced back out through the grimy window, she could see that, indeed, waves of people, all clutching flyers, were now rolling past with regularity. A flyer finally availed itself to her, fluttering from the open doorway to the floor near her feet.</p>

<p>“I know we're on stakeout,” she said, examining the flyer. “But it's been a few hours and I don't think anyone's coming to get our note. But if Tarkanan is promising to convert people tonight,” she continued, holding it up to her friends, “then they have to have the dragonseye there, right?”</p>

<p>Snipe nodded.</p>

<p>“I agree, it's time to bail, Lotar's magnanimous hosting aside. Finding the warehouse where they're pulling off this event is our best bet.”</p>

<p>“That might not be so easy,” Ven said uneasily. “The flyer doesn't say which warehouse, just to head to the <em>Precarious</em> district.”</p>

<p>“Makes sense though, right?” Jab said. “If they dropped these overnight, the Sharn Watch could set up at any warehouse. But they can't lock down the entire district. We'll just have to follow the crowds. They must be passing information <em>somehow</em>.”</p>

<p>Brim nodded.</p>

<p>“Okay, let's go then,” she said. “The crowds look like they're getting bigger and bigger. We probably want to get there as soon as we can to have time to scout.”</p>

<p>The group stood, their half collapsed table immediately seized upon by two separate groups of dockworkers who immediately set to throwing fists over it, and stepped out into the street.</p>

<p>“Wait,” Snipe said, holding up a hand. “I have to check one thing, for my own sanity.”</p>

<p>Brim watched as he darted across the street into the alley, removed the brick, cursed, and returned to the group with it.</p>

<p>“I'm such an <em>idiot</em>,” he said. “Our message <em>was</em> delivered. Look.”</p>

<p>He pointed to the interior of the false brick, which was devoid of their note. On the back wall of the inside, glowing slightly, was a clearly arcane rune.</p>

<p>“They must be rigged to somehow transfer the information as soon as it's placed inside,” Snipe said, groaning. “Dys played us for fools.”</p>

<p>Jab chuckled. “It's a good thing we have a new lead then!”</p>

<p>And with that, the four melted into the tumultuous crowd, letting themselves be carried toward <em>Precarious</em>.</p>
<h1 id="chapter-15">Chapter 15</h1>

<h2 id="four-years-ago">Four Years Ago</h2>

<p>With an understated flourish, Aaren d'Cannith removed the rag of polish from the hardened metal surface, inspected it closely, and retrieved a screwdriver to tighten a few errant bolts and screws. From within a few joints in the surface, a light blue glow emanated from within the interior of the machine.</p>

<p>“There, good as new,” he said, patting the thing with some fondness.</p>

<p>Of course, this was far from the truth. <em>New</em> was before the war. <em>New</em> was a much younger, less weary Aaren, fervent with purpose in the forging of an instrument of destruction. <em>New</em> was a new type of being, neither creature nor machine — a construct, but imbued with enough consciousness to serve without direct control. Expendable, powerful, and most importantly, enslaved. A soldier.</p>

<p>New was having purpose, and now, this thing had none. This did not particularly occur to Aaren, who had never quite arrived at a strong conclusion about the thing’s consciousness to begin with. Perhaps it was because he created it of his own hand, but he never really saw it as a separate entity from himself.</p>

<p>Of course, the thing on the table before him had so many new parts — not to mention the odd upgrade — that Aaren could scarcely name a component within it that remained from the previous build.</p>

<p><em>Perhaps it’s  for the better,</em> he thought, considering the machine’s longevity. He did not stop to think whether swapping every interior part in this being might affect its mental state upon waking up.</p>

<p>In any case, he had no intentions of ever waking it up. Since the passing of the treaty, the thing would be free as soon as he awoke it, and that served him no purpose at all. Parts were expensive, and he had little use of his walking out the front door.</p>

<p>With movements that belied his considerable age, he drifted to a second workbench in his laboratory. He sat down and swept his gaze across the series of faceplates and metallic heads that stared back at him with lifeless eyes from their perches.</p>

<p>“Now, which of you would serve dear Boranel well in the coming war?” he asked, lightly rolling his eyes at his own cynicism. True, peace currently held in these lands, but he had no doubt that the legions of freed warforged roaming Eberron would be conscripted back into combat the moment it all went aflame.</p>

<p>He selected one of the heads, clearly more finely crafted than the others — perhaps a sign of his softening heart. Its backing was gold, with thin strips of white metal extending down the back. The faceplate itself, rather than the standard metal plate with “eye” slits and a perfunctory mouth slit, appeared to be smooth and black, like obsidian. Aaren reached out to a small arcane device sitting on the table, pulling the cube-shaped ember into his hand. Turning the headpiece to peer up inside, he slotted the ember into place with a satisfying click.</p>

<p>At this, the head began to whir slightly, and turning it back to the front, Aaren watched as a small series of bulbs lining the inside of the black plate lit up one by one, then all together, and finally, began to trace out intricate moving shapes and designs. A small tear threatened to drip from his eye at the sight — this was one of his finest accomplishments — but it never quite breached his eye.</p>

<p>Instead, he carried the head back over to the splayed robotic body laying on the workbench behind him. As he held the head above the neck region of the thing, he felt a tug and let go with satisfaction, watching the magnetic couplings capture the head and hold it in place a few inches above the body.</p>

<p>He took a moment to examine the body, ignoring slightly the creeping feeling that, now that it had a head on it, and for all its robotic nature, it now seemed to resemble a corpse.</p>

<p>It was in part due to the shabbyness of his laboratory. Once, Aaren d'Cannith commanded the most advanced creation forges in Cyre, bustling workshops with hundreds of workers and a near infinite set of material to work with. And at their beating heart, the forges themselves, from which new life emerged. Where in his old lab, his creation would stand tall, supported by reinforced strutted stands, here it lay unceremoniously across the bench.</p>

<p>In some ways, what laid before him now was ugly — particularly by an artificer’s standards. A hodgepodge of different metallic hues, some owing to the natural color of the metal, others to the magically imbued color that had once graced the machine or building that hosted it, the revitalized warforged on the table before him seemed a mess of contradictions.</p>

<p>Its breastplate was a curved piece of red, while strips of blue, gold, copper, and even a strip of malleable wood here and there snaked outward, fitting together like pieces of a macabre, nonsensical puzzle.</p>

<p>Aaren’s memory flashed back to the gleaming, all-silver construct he had delivered those years ago, and he sighed.</p>

<p><em>Perhaps,</em> he thought, <em>this thing was a better representation of the times. Functional, but broken nonetheless.</em> Or if not broken, incomplete, incoherent. Aimless, like him.</p>

<p>It had been more than thirty years since Aaren d'Cannith's epiphany — the breakthrough that led to the sentience of the warforged. It was now nearing twenty years since he abdicated his position in the house, abandoned his Cannith names and holdings, and retreated to a lonely, abandonded tower in the Aundairian countryside.</p>

<p>Aaren then reached into a drawer, stopping a moment to really observe the wrinkles beginning to snake across the top of his hands. Age had done nothing to reduce his dexterity with machines, or to strip away his gifts. But perhaps in part due to that, his general physical frailty now often surprised him.</p>

<p>Shrugging the feeling off, he pulled out a considerably hefty diamond. It was sharply and finely cut, but not to the specifications of any piece of recognizable jewelry. The stone itself represented most of Aaren’s remaining wealth, and, after a few moments of weighing it in his hand, the elf carefully leaned over the construct on the table and, with ginger fingers, dropped it into a cavity in the center of the thing’s chest.</p>

<p>As it locked into place, beams of blue light began refracting through it, as physical attachments extended out from the interior mechanical workings to better secure it in its housing.</p>

<p>He  stood, placing another light hand on the construct’s shoulder.</p>

<p><em>Never wake, my friend,</em> he thought. <em>Your creation was an exercise in futility — both times, really — but I am one of a great many flaws, and I’m rather afraid that in my old age, few of my virtues can withstand the vice of my vanity. I only regret forcing my own cornerstone upon you. Alas.</em></p>

<p>Aaren turned, briefly eyeing the large smithing hammer hanging from a neighboring table, before walking to the edge of the workshop. Ducking through a small archway, he emerged onto a balcony overlooking the soft rolling hills of the countryside. He took an uncertain step onto the ledge, glancing at the stone patio at the bottom of the tower.</p>

<p>He closed his eyes, considering his life a final time. He stepped a foot out over the edge.</p>

<p>“Now, Uncle,” came a cold voice from over his shoulder. “Let's not be rash.”</p>

<p>Aaren felt a tug at his skin, knowing it to be the workings of an arcane hold on him, keeping him fixed in place. He turned his head, and with resignation, saw Merrix d'Cannith stepping out from the shadows of his workshop.</p>

<p>“We still have work to do,” Merrix said, holding out a hand.</p>
<h1 id="chapter-16">Chapter 16</h1>

<p>Precarious at night was even more foreboding than in the daytime, when at least some light from the tower's edges filtered into the cavernous space</p>

<p>Now, the glow of the everlight lanterns adorning the warehouses faded up into inky blackness above, the high arched yieldings no longer visible. It was a void like the deepest night, with no stars for comfort or guidance.</p>

<p>Ven shivered. She could <em>feel</em> the layer of grime on her skin as it adopted the grime and soot the lower city's air carried, brought up from the cogs below and with nowhere, really, to go.</p>

<p>She hated everything about what was happening, what they were about to attempt to do. She laughed, briefly, at the irony. She'd run away from Sharn to find her freedom, the autonomy to follow the path <em>she</em> wished. And yet, time after the time, the universe had shoved circumstances upon her she could no more easily escape than her family's drama. First, the Mourning had changed her life forever. Had nearly ended it, and in some ways, had succeeded. Then, as if she hadn't suffered enough, an unasked for, unwanted dragonmark on her skin.</p>

<p><em>And now I'm traipsing through Lower Dura in a crowd of frenzied dockworkers seeking unknown powers,</em> she thought. For all she knew, that would be followed immediately by riots as they brought that power to bear against their oppressors in the upper city.</p>

<p>She grimaced. <em>Which is me, technically</em>.</p>

<p>As Ven and her companions filtered through the ever-growing crowd, she began to grow nervous that they'd never be able to find the actual warehouse Tarkanan would be at. As they neared the center of Precarious, she could feel the nerves in the crowd, as the momentum sputtered and people began loudly questioning where to go next.</p>

<p>She heard Jab trying in vain to ask passersby about the missing warforged. A few gave quick, vague answers, but clearly everyone's minds were elsewhere. She exchanged a nervous look with Snipe. <em>Now what?</em></p>

<p>Her question was answered when a halfling pushed his way through them, grunting and heaving with the exertion of parting the crowd of much larger individuals.</p>

<p>“Will—you—let—me—through!?” he exclaimed, throwing an elbow into Brim's calf but finding himself wedged between her and a burly orcish dockworker next to her. Brim looked down in surprise at the figure.</p>

<p>“Do you ah, need some help?” Brim asked, reaching down a hand. “I could lift you up and over.” The halfling, who bore a long, twisting scar from the top of his forehead down to his neck, pouted and attempted to cross his arms, but couldn't finish the gesture, stuck as he was. He yelped as another body pressing in caught the hair of his pulled-back ponytail.</p>

<p>“Fine!” he conceded, wrenching one arm free and sending it up to meet Brim's. Her hand could fit around the entirety of his hand and wrist. Ven watched in slight amusement as Brim slowly yanked him free over his protestations of pain. She seemed unsure of what to do next.</p>

<p>“On your shoulder,” he said with a dramatic sigh. “Khyber below, this crowd is a nightmare.”</p>

<p>Brim put out an arm for balance as the halfling perched on one shoulder, foot tucked in the crook of her elbow.</p>

<p>“Sovereigns, I can see so much fucking better up here,” he continued. “You tree-built really have it good. Alright. That way!” He pointed through the crowd toward the direction of the cliffs.</p>

<p>“You know where to go?” Brim asked, glancing up at him. “I'm Brim, by the way. These are my friends.”</p>

<p>The halfling peered down at the rest of them with suspicion.</p>

<p>“Garmaiel. You're not from the lower city, clearly. What brings you to this obviously revolutionary march?” Leaning down to speak more conspiratorially, he said “I do know where to go. Word's been spreading slowly but surely. There's six warehouses tonight. No one knows which they'll actually be at, but I know where the options are. We have to take our chances at one.”</p>

<p><em>That's not great,</em> Ven thought. <em>One and six chance. Just like a gambling die.</em> She saw Snipe throw her another look, before he looked up at Garmaiel and asked,</p>

<p>“How close together are the six?”</p>

<p>“The warehouses? They're close, walk-able, but not so close the Watch could watch two at once,” Garmaiel responded.</p>

<p>Snipe glanced at her again. <em>Ah,</em> she thought. <em>If we can get close enough, maybe we'll sense it again.</em></p>

<p>The thought sent a shudder through her. Annoyed with herself as she was for not noticing the dull sense of foreboding in the back of her mind and the high pitched, barely discernible whine at the theater that had broadcast the dragonseye's presence, she realized she had no desire to hear it again. It felt… wrong, somehow.</p>

<p>They continued shuffling forward with the crowd until it finally started to thin out, with other gaggles of workers looking around in confusion for more instruction. As they neared the edge of a small square, a few alleys looked blessedly empty, and they darted within. Garmaiel jumped down off Brim's shoulder with obvious relief.</p>

<p>Under Garmaiel's instruction, they navigated the maze-like corridors and back alleys until they reached another thoroughfare — this one ran parallel to the cliff, where the massive elevator docks currently sat dormant.</p>

<p>They once again joined the rolling masses of people, though now, Garmiael assured, significantly closer to their destination. The crowd here was less oppressive, the feeling aided by being out in the open air again. Many around them also seemed more sure-footed, walking with purpose.</p>

<p><em>Others with inside information,</em> Ven thought. She hoped the halfling's intel was accurate, but had to admit they had nothing better to go on. Trying to tune out the noise of the crowd, Ven tried to focus and see if she could sense anything from the device. It was hard to tell.</p>

<p>A few minutes later, they arrived at what must've been the first of the warehouses. A fraction of the crowd was peeling off, flowing into open double doors at the side of the building. Others continued on, resolute in their knowledge this was not the right building. Others still seemed unsure, looking to make their gamble.</p>

<p>Ven shot looks at Snipe, Brim, and Jab, as they all concentrated on the feeling of the device. She shook her head. They responded in kind. As they continued, Garmaiel perked up.</p>

<p>“Oh, so you do have some information of your own,” he crowed. “Guess we can be useful to each other after all.”</p>

<p>Ven grimaced.</p>

<p>“I think we've helped each other plenty already, wouldn't you say?” she asked, fervently hoping Garmaiel got the message. They didn't need to be worried about him in all this. And Ven would much rather him end up at one of the dummy warehouses, where he'd be spared the conversion.</p>

<p><em>He's making his own choice,</em> a small part of her thought sharply. <em>It's not like your own choices have led anywhere but pain. You'd still want the right to make them.</em></p>

<p>Ven frowned. Where had that thought come from? It was unambiguously her own thought, yet… something felt alien about it. She shrugged it off, the unease remaining.</p>

<p>Suddenly, she felt it. The whine. And, she realized, a draw, tugging her, whispering to come closer. Like to like. A quick glance at Snipe and Jab confirmed it. They were close.</p>

<p>As they approached the next of the warehouses that had activity surrounding it, she reached down and tapped Garmaiel on the shoulder.</p>

<p>“I think this is where our journey together ends,” she said. “Good luck.”</p>

<p>Garmaiel squinted at them, seeming to determine if they were bluffing, or double bluffing him. After a long moment, he shrugged, and followed the crowd into the building.</p>

<p>“His life's going to be really different tomorrow,” Ven said quietly.</p>

<p>“Not if we stop this,” Brim said, laying a hand on her shoulder. Ven nodded, steeling herself.</p>

<p>“I'm guessing we shouldn't go in the front,” Snipe mused. “We'll just be stuck in the crowd waiting with everyone else to get blasted.”</p>

<p>“Back door?” Jab asked. Snipe shrugged. “Worth a shot. Bet there'll be Tarkanan back there though…”</p>

<p>Ven swallowed. They stepped into an alley one warehouse over and wrapped around to the back of Warehouse 65B-41L Cliffside, Precarious. They found a locked, unguarded door. Cracking a knuckle, Snipe knelt down and began to pick, as the whine in their minds grew louder, and the faintest sheen of red colored their vision.</p>
<h1 id="chapter-17">Chapter 17</h1>

<p>Jab could hear the rumble of the crowd through the walls. Excitement, nervousness. Skepticism, anger. He wasn't fully familiar with everything in the stew of emotions the fleshy races were exuding in this space, but he let them wash over him nonetheless. There was something so alive about it.</p>

<p>He knew he was alive, of course. But as he came to know Brim, Snipe, and Ven, he realized that his thoughts were… not lesser, but simpler. No, that wasn't right either. He was capable of equally, if not more, complex thought. Rational thought.</p>

<p><em>That's the difference,</em> he thought. His thoughts may be similar in many ways to his companions, but they were nearly always rational. Cause and effect. If this, then that. He wasn't always <em>correct</em> about his assessments of the world — but that was because, he realized, the world didn't often actually <em>make sense</em>.</p>

<p>Take Ven. The woman was a walking <em>mess</em> of contradictions, hating her house and family yet seeming to care deeply for the silver haired Lyrandar woman who'd brought wine to their apartment. She knew, and opposed, the propaganda the Dragonmarked houses supposedly trafficked in… but her negative reaction to aberrant dragonmarks seemed deeply rooted in House dogma. <em>He</em> certainly didn't feel that way. The mark was a gift, and a tool. It hurt, sometimes, but so did everything in life. And he knew Brim and Snipe didn't seem to harbor quite the same negative feelings about it.</p>

<p><em>And clearly, neither does anyone in this warehouse</em>, he thought, trying to return to the task at hand.</p>

<p>But the thought dogged him. He'd desired, since he found the Mothers, to obtain whatever it was these people had that warforged didn't — The ability to reproduce, to not be <em>created</em> by someone's hand. But that was still kind of abstract. Jab realized that, at a functional level, he felt himself made othered from his friends in part <em>because</em> they made no sense. They were messy, complicated people, and Jab felt simple by comparison.</p>

<p>To be fair, he was young, even by warforged standards. The oldest of his race were, as far as anyone could tell officially, roughly thirty-two years in age. The majority were closer to ten. Jab was… less than that.</p>

<p>He didn't remember his creation, nor “coming online,” as others called it. He'd learned later that warforged were created with fully mature processing and temperament — they could learn and change during their lives, but they didn't have a childhood. Apparently, early testing showed that having a fully conscious being pop into existence fully formed led rather quickly to some form of insanity. Documentation was scarce; most of it was lost in the Mourning.</p>

<p>And so, warforged were created in a form of “half-stasis,” during which some of their processing was limited, and none of their experiences were recorded in their memories. Slowly, both features increased in strength up until Jab was much as he found himself today. If he peered back through his memory, everything eventually became lost in a fuzzy fog.</p>

<p>Jab snapped back into reality at the sound of a satisfying click, as Snipe slid the final lock tumbler into place and slowly pushed the heavyset door inward. He crouched next to Snipe.</p>

<p>“What's the plan?” he whispered.</p>

<p>“I love that you see me as some type of roguish fiend with `plans', Jab.” Snipe laughed. “Deathsgate members… we usually just stumble into the sites of our contracts and shoot stuff that's shooting at us until nothing is shooting anymore.”</p>

<p>Jab heard Ven snort from behind him. She'd make a good spy too, he figured. He could never tell what was going on in that head of hers.</p>

<p>“Alright,” he said, steadying his spear. “I'll stab anything that comes for me and go from there.”</p>

<p>“Don't you mean `jab' anything?” Brim ask, stifling her own giggle.</p>

<p><em>What was it about abject danger that made people so giggly?</em> he thought. He didn't have time to consider it too deeply. It was time to move.</p>

<p>Slipping into the slight gap left by the ajar door, Jab crouched in the darkness of the room.</p>

<p><em>You really would've thought constructed soldiers would've been given some capacity to see in the dark,</em> he thought bitterly. He envisioned Merrix's face before him, then scrunched his face in annoyance at it. His real face plates, of course, didn't budge.</p>

<p>The darkened hallway was devoid of light, but not of sound, which Jab was much more adept at discerning. He pressed a hand to the ground and let the subtle vibrations supplant the sound waves that reached his sonic pick-ups.</p>

<p>“The Mistress will be arriving shortly,” came a scratchy voice from around the corner. “It's time to take our places.” 
Jab turned and gestured to his friends, who'd just finished slipping through the door. Snipe eased it closed, as they all pressed themselves into the nooks of the bare stone construction.</p>

<p>Moments later, a single torchlight emerged around the corner, illuminating a pockmarked face and wild, scraggly hair. The glowing red eyes gave them away as Tarkanan.</p>

<p>As Jab considered a course of action, two things happened simultaneously. The figure froze in place, as if bound by ropes. Jab glanced over to see Ven's somatic gestures. Looking back at the sentry, he saw a bolt shoot down the hallway and cleanly pierce the man's neck. He sagged into the invisible hold upon him, and Ven released it shortly thereafter, leaving the body to thump to the floor.</p>

<p>“Was that necessary!?” Ven whispered furiously at Snipe. “I had him held!”</p>

<p>“That doesn't always work,” he whispered back nonchalantly. “And in my experience, they can still grunt pretty loudly in that condition.”</p>

<p>Ven looked about ready to slap him, but Brim put a hand to her shoulder.</p>

<p>“I don't want to hurt anyone either,” she murmured. “But these Tarkanan folks have been trying to hurt us since we met them. We have a task. I don't think now's the moment to heavily weigh collateral.”</p>

<p>Ven stood for a moment, breathing heavily, then her shoulders dropped in resignation.</p>

<p>“Fine. Let's go,” she said. “But Sovereigns above, let's not leave bodies in our wake we don't absolutely have to.”</p>

<p>As they walked forward, Jab turned and saw her stop to briefly test a pulse on the figure's neck. Grimacing, she stood and joined the rest of them as they rounded the corner.</p>

<p>Ahead they faced a long passage, which seemed to trace the length of the long warehouse. Jab felt his vision adjusting. About 50 feet ahead, two points of light — torches — illuminated the otherwise darkened hallway, and two Tarkanan enforcers lounged leaning against the walls, chatting.</p>

<p>As Snipe moved to raise his crossbow and Ven moved to stop him, Jab felt a vibration through his feet. Voices, more distinct than the rumble of the crowd through the wall, and… below them?</p>

<p>He held up two arms to stop both his companions, and gestured down through the floor at an angle. After a moment, he heard Ven whisper</p>

<p>“Under the floor? Just like at the theater.”</p>

<p>He nodded, then inched forward, feeling along the wall for loose stones or hidden catches that might open a passage downward. Around him, Ven and Snipe did the same on the floor and opposite wall, while Brim, amusingly, seemed to be feeling along the ceiling.</p>

<p>Snipe found it, thankfully after only around 25 feet of inching forward; any more and they'd risk easy spotting by the guards ahead. As Snipe pulled a switch built into an unlit sconce, Jab watched as the wall to their left slid inwards and to the left. 
The sound of scraping stone immediately drew the attention of the guards.</p>

<p>“They here already?” one asked the other, suspicious, as Jab willed the stone to move faster. “Thought it'd be a little longer,” the other replied. They both turned down the hall just as Jab followed the rest of the party into the passage.</p>

<p>“Please tell me there's a way to close it,” he whispered.</p>

<p>Snipe grunted.</p>

<p>“Always easier on this side,” he said, yanking a large lever in the wall to which Jab's eyes hadn't even yet grown accustomed enough to see.</p>

<p>The false stone of the wall slid shut behind them just as the footsteps of the questioning enforcers approached.</p>

<p>“You'd think they'd at least grace us with a hello,” one said, dejectedly. “I'd been hoping to meet the Mistress tonight.”</p>

<p>“In time,” said the other, now muffled through several inches of wood and stone. “Working a job like this well, you're sure to be raised up soon.”</p>

<p>Jab turned to see most of his group had crept down the staircase. He hustled down to catch up, and joined them as they emerged into a roughly four foot high crawlspace between the warehouse floor.</p>

<p>He wondered what use such a space would serve. As they crouched over and began to edge forward in the pitch darkness, he felt the whine growing stronger in his head. None of them had mentioned it aloud yet, but the pull toward the device was nearly second nature.</p>

<p>He was surprised to find that the floor beneath his feet was angled. Not strongly, but at least several degrees. That was when he connected his surroundings with the vaguely fishy smell that pervaded his senses. Smell was also not one of his strongest suits.</p>

<p>He heard a noise from Ven next to him that sounded vaguely like a gag.</p>

<p><em>Okay, very fishy, then</em> he thought. The crawlspace began to make some sense. <em>This warehouse handles fish from the river,</em> he thought. <em>They bring pallets or nets up but this space lets the water drain back out towards the cliffs.</em></p>

<p>Jab's hearing, in contrast, was nearly overwhelmed by the sounds piercing straight down through the floorboards above. Feet stamped, voices grumbled. The whole floor above seemed about ready to collapse under the weight, wood beams groaning around him.</p>

<p>Then everything went quiet.</p>

<p>Jab stopped moving, as did his companions, feeling the prickling sensation of something changing. The crowd had stilled above.</p>

<p>“Welcome, my dearest friends,” rang a loud, clear voice, tinged with an accent Jab couldn't place. It was female, but low in timbre, with a rumble and gravitas he'd never heard. A low murmur passed through the crowd above.</p>

<p>“I want to commend you all on your bravery this night. We offer you a great power, but also the trust that you will use this power to help make our city a more equitable, more welcoming place.”</p>

<p>Jab heard a swelling assent from the crowd. Next to him, Snipe and Ven began to creep forward again, toward the whine. Brim was on all fours, given the height of the space.</p>

<p>“Sharn is <em>magnificent</em>,” called the voice above, carving a melody into the air. “A true wonder of our world! But look no further than the War of the Mark to learn that some in power would see Sharn crumble before giving any rights to the disenfranchised!”</p>

<p>At this, the floorboards above him erupted into pounding as the assembled workers whooped and stomped in agreement.</p>

<p>“You have been led to fear aberrant dragonmarks. You've been told they are evil. You've heard stories long passed into myth of powerful mages exerting their will upon Khorvaire with aberrant power,” the voice continued solemnly, as the pounding died down.</p>

<p>“Yet do the Dragonmarked houses not wield their power to do the very same!?” the voice boomed, to thunderous assent. “Do they not feed us this fear to keep us docile? Keep us tending the docks, the warehouses, the brothels, and the taverns of the lower city upon which the wealth of the Skyway is built!?”</p>

<p>Jab could barely hear his thoughts over the stomping of the floor above him. He realized the woman must be projecting with some sort of thaumaturgic spell to overpower those cheers.</p>

<p>“Well I ask you now,” she called, stoking the flames. “The Houses rose out of conformity, out of their marks behaving in lockstep with their goals, and their scions bowing to the wills of their elders,”</p>

<p>Jab glanced at Ven, but her face was shadowed in the darkness. 
“Do they not have far more to fear from us, from the masses armed not with docile, industrial marks, but marks of power?” Tarkanan continued. “Marks that were once hunted down because of their fear of us, and marks which, if united, could bring this city to its knees?”</p>

<p>The crowd above seemed, to Jab's attestation, to be losing their minds.</p>

<p>“You saw our proof at the Diamond Theatre,” the voice called out, bringing the room above, somehow, to a whisper. “This is my aberrant power. To bring this choice to you all. The road ahead will be fraught with danger. But together, we can show the houses that we are not chattel to be smeared under their foot.</p>

<p>“You all are the first, truly the first, to claim this power for yourselves <em>by choice</em>. And you need not even fight. Our numbers, which will soon swell and overflow from Lower Dura to Middle Central and beyond, will be enough to force the houses to recognize us as what we truly are: A powerful house in our own right.”</p>

<p>The voice paused for truly dramatic effect.</p>

<p>“House Tarkanan,” she roared, and the frenzied crowd fully lost all control of their senses. It sounded like a rampage was occuring above his head, but Jab knew it to be the stamping, jumping, and screaming of fervent support.</p>

<p>“It is time, my loves,” called the voice. “If you wish leave of this power, leave now. For in moments, we shall all be transformed together…”</p>

<hr />

<p><em>Dolurrh!</em> Ven thought. <em>We're out of time!</em></p>

<p>As she crawl-hunched forward in the darkness, not daring to produce any light and drawn only by the tug in her chest that drove her forward, Ven felt a terrible unease at the words being broadcast above her head.</p>

<p>Mistress Tarkanan was evil. That was an undisputable fact.</p>

<p>Right?</p>

<p>Ven knew by now that Tarkanan's “house” was known as a terrorist organization not because of any ideals, but because they trained murderers and assassins and enforcers who were a danger to society.</p>

<p><em>And what jobs, honest jobs, would a spontaneous aberrant bearer be hired for?</em> she thought. She shook her head. Where <em>were</em> these thoughts coming from?</p>

<p><em>You don't think House Lyrandar — all the houses — didn't have good reason to paint abberants in a negative light?</em> she berated herself. <em>The houses wiped them out once. They'd do it again.</em></p>

<p>Ven nearly clawed at her own skull. <em>Now is not the time,</em> she thought, trying to corral what appeared to be warring factions in her brain. <em>Find the dragonseye.</em></p>

<p>As if answering her prayer, she saw a flash of light up ahead. Instinctively, she and the others rushed forward, knowing precious little time was left to stop the device from activating.</p>

<p>They stumbled over an unexpected edge, and fell into a storeroom that was carved down an addition ten or so feet into the stone. The room was littered with piled up crates and barrels, the floor a solid inch and a half of brine and water, and in its center, four individuals stood tall around a spherical metallic device. The whine in their heads was now more like a scream. Red tendrils were beginning to reach, tentatively, from out between the metal banding of the device.</p>

<p>The four Tarkanan agents looked up at the crash of their entry. Ven began to cast.</p>
<h1 id="chapter-18">Chapter 18</h1>

<p>Snipe dived behind cover, sliding his crossbow out from behind his back with precision.</p>

<p>This was what he was good at. He liked his objectives simple, and ideally, within eyesight. Everything else could be dealt with.</p>

<p>As one of the Tarkanan agents waved and arm and tossed the crates serving as his cover to the side, he admitted he might have to revise that creed when magic users were involved.</p>

<p>Nevertheless, the sudden lack of cover impelled him to fire, and he managed to lodge a crossbow bolt into the thigh of the evidently telekinetic agent. The half-elf had spindly, woven gray hair, and wore an obnoxious duster with a collar that rose to his ears.</p>

<p>Snipe leaped toward another set of barrels. <em>You'll have to hit him somewhere a bit more vital to stop him annihilating your cover,</em> he thought.</p>

<p>He deftly reloaded his crossbow while also drawing a dagger from his belt for insurance. <em>This time, you won't know where I am,</em> he thought with a grim smile.</p>

<p>Rather than popping up and attacking, he rolled to a separate stack of crates, hoping to earn himself a surprise appearance. As he reached forward to brace against the crates, he realized he couldn't see his own arm.</p>

<hr />

<p>As Jab took note of his surroundings, he immediately realized something. There, just to the left of the dragonseye, eyeing him up, was a face he recognized.</p>

<p><em>I let you escape once,</em> Jab thought, immediately walking toward him, actuators whirring and hissing as his arms and legs prepared for combat.</p>

<p>Sbar'n only smiled wickedly as he approached.</p>

<hr />

<p>Ven eyed the device sitting on a small makeshift crate-table in the center of the circle of Tarkanan agents.</p>

<p><em>The device is the objective,</em> she thought to herself, trying to ignore the battle bursting out around her. Kneeling behind a stack of crates, she concentrated, reaching for the flaming energy that now burned at her core. Calling out, Ven summoned the energetic sprite of Cinder from whatever void she lived in within her, and the fox appeared in a burst of orange flame before here.</p>

<p><em>You've been awefully dismissive of my input lately,</em> she heard. No, she <em>thought</em>.</p>

<p><em>Wait,</em> she exclaimed, internally. <em>That's been you?</em></p>

<p>The fox only yipped in annoyance, as if to say, <em>No time for this now, silly woman.</em></p>

<p>Ven shook her head. She might be going crazy, but her crazy intuition was right. She looked at the fox.</p>

<p>“Think you can get to that metal sphere?” she asked.</p>

<hr />

<p><em>Onatar,</em> Brim prayed, as they arrayed out and immediately drew the arcane fire of the agents before them. <em>We're… the good guys, right?</em></p>

<p>She'd been more affected by Mistress Tarkanan's speech than she'd have liked. She knew the woman was likely a practicated orator, but still… Brim had nothing against Ven as a person, but it certainly seemed like the Dragonmarked-House world she came from was responsible for a lot of pain.</p>

<p><em>Like running my family out of business</em>, she thought, suddenly remembering her whole purpose in this city.</p>

<p>If Brim had learned anything since coming to Sharn, it was that there were twenty sides to every story. As she held up her shield and deflected a bolt of lightning that danced her way from one of the agents, she tried to push aside thoughts of which side was ultimately right, and focus on the moment at hand.</p>

<p>Calling on Onatar's strength, Brim conjured a cleansing flame. <em>Good for clearing imperfections off a sword,</em> she thought. <em>Apparently also good against people,</em> she concluded, as the white flame shot forward and sent two of the agents diving behind cover. She hit the last square in the back, and as he was wreathed in light, he twisted around, and she saw his reddened eyes flare bright against it.</p>

<hr />

<p><em>Use It…</em></p>

<p>The whisper came to Snipe not verbally, but as a feeling, a yearning. He frowned, pausing as he reloaded his crossbow, hiding behind several barrels which were getting charred by return fire from the center of the room.</p>

<p><em>Use what?</em> he thought, as he peered around the cover to wait for Brim to let off another searing burst of radiant flame. She soon obliged, and Snipe took advantage of the distraction to loose another bolt into one of the agent's sides. No one seemed to track him.</p>

<p><em>Makes sense,</em> he thought in the part of his mind not dedicated to the flow of combat. <em>Somehow, I'm invisible</em>.</p>

<p>There was a buzzing about him, and energy he hadn't ever felt before, animating his movement, nudging him forward. The energy that spread across him from his mark. <em>Is it powering this invisibility?</em> he thought. <em>Doesn't seem to be draining me…</em></p>

<p>Suddenly, he felt a pain flare in his side. He grunted, turning to see that one of the agents had managed to sneak around his cover and stab into him from the side with a thin sword. He watched in horror as he dissolved back into reality, starting from the wound and expanding outward, the invisibility lost. He could already feel the blood loss, the deliberating effect of shock setting in.</p>

<p><em>No you don't,</em> he growled, <em>that's my trick</em>. Focusing, he felt his muscles grow taught and begin expanding, the skin above them stretching and sprouting tufts of fur. The shift infused him with new energy, the pain in his side receded to a dull thump. He glanced down to see that the wound was still there, but the fur which has grown around it was aiding in staunching it, forming an ugly clot.</p>

<p><em>It'll do</em>, he thought, leaping forward and drawing his dagger and rapier.</p>

<p>The figure before him was spindly and pale — a strong contrast to the more sculpted visage of Sbar'n, who he could see from the corner of his eye trading blows with Jab. Sbar'n was stronger; Jab was faster. It seemed to be a fair enough fight.</p>

<p>The man before Snipe — <em>boy, really</em>, he thought, <em>Can't be more than 15 or 16</em> — wore ragged robes and had a snaking tattoo which zig-zagged across his face, emanating from the temples and spreading around the eyes.</p>

<p>Snipe's first strike with the rapier missed, but as the boy countered, he learned a valuable insight into his opponent; the boy had seized the opportunity provided by Snipe's strike to attack his weak side. Snipe easily parried it off the hilt of his dagger.</p>

<p><em>He telegraphs his moves; must not have fought many dual wielders,</em> Snipe thought. He jumped back and circled around, trying to put his back to the wall so he could also see the rest of the fight unfolding. It was time for his trick.</p>

<p>Snipe smiled wide at the boy, his toothy grin accentuated by the sharper teeth that accentuated his shifted form. He saw a flit of fear pass over the boy's smouldering eyes. <em>A fight is truly a mental battle,</em> he thought. <em>Once I'm in his head, it's over.</em></p>

<p>He felt the tug, the urge again. <em>Use it…</em></p>

<p>Snipe squinted, trying not to let his focus lapse as he parried off another probing strike from the boy. They were still testing each other.</p>

<p><em>How?</em> he thought. He'd never used a Dragonmark before, obviously. But moreover, unlike Brim or Ven, he'd never been a spellcaster to begin with. He'd always avoided the lot, and if possible, avoided jobs that ended up clashing with them. Too many unknowns.</p>

<p>Snipe waited for a particularly loud explosion to sound off behind the boy, then used the temporary distraction to close the distance and strike again. Annoyingly, the boy turned back just in time to sidestep and smash the hilt of his sword down into Snipe's outstretched wrist.</p>

<p>They faced each other again, Snipe now attempting to hide the pain in his wrist from his expression.</p>

<p><em>He's toying with me,</em> Snipe realized suddenly. <em>The fear is a show</em>. It had to be. The boy had been <em>barely</em> evading his attacks, looking for all purposes desperate and at the edge of his limit. But Snipe had <em>seen</em> him turn to glance behind him at the explosion. The only way he could've reacted to Snipe's blow in time was if he were baiting the attack.</p>

<p>Snipe fell a chill come over him. <em>They wouldn't send a green recruit on an important mission like this,</em> he realized.</p>

<p>The boy smiled suddenly, returning Snipe's intimidation tactic. This time — perhaps only this time — it was Snipe who balked.</p>

<p><em>What can he do?</em> he thought.</p>

<p>He soon found out.</p>

<p>With a flourish, the boy leaped forward, dancing toward, away, and around Snipe faster than he could even track. He seemed to move with supernatural speed, and though Snipe swung wildly in response, spinning to follow him, his blade <em>always</em> missed by mere hairs. Meanwhile, the boy was slicing at him over and over.</p>

<p><em>He knows that won't kill me</em>, Snipe thought desperately, as the stabbing-oriented weapon left him crisscrossed with painful — but nonlethal — gashes. <em>What's his game?</em></p>

<p>It took him a few extra moments in the fog of the fight to realize it.</p>

<p><em>He's just stalling to keeping me from the others!</em> He couldn't afford to look, not while under the constant barrage of swipes, but he couldn't help but glance over toward the rest of the battle to see why he was being held in distraction.</p>

<p>It was the opening his opponent was waiting for. In a blink, the boy was up against him, holding him in an almost tender embrace with one arm, his rapier stabbed straight through Snipe's abdomen by the other. He felt hot breath in his ear.</p>

<p>“You've learned not to underestimate me,” the boy whispered, the voice steady despite its youth. “Soon, Sharn will learn they underestimated House Tarkanan.”</p>

<p>He twisted the rapier, sending a spasm of pain shuddering through Snipe's form. Then he slid the blade out, letting Snipe fall to the floor, and turned back to the rest of the battle.</p>

<hr />

<p>Jab was coming to realize it was challenging to have a decent conversation with someone while trading blows.</p>

<p>He'd made straight for the imposing figure of Sbar'n, if anything simply to take responsibility for his own poor rope-tying skills earlier. But that didn't mean they couldn't have a pleasant conversation, right?</p>

<p>“You're exceedingly strange,” Sbar'n had managed while Jab re-introduced himself over a barrage of fists and elbows.</p>

<p><em>It's funny,</em> he thought. <em>You've never really had any desire to kill… but isn't that what Merrix made you for?</em> He, of course, wasn't directly built by Merrix. But the mysterious nature of his “youth” — if he fought in the Last War, as all warforged were built to, he had no memory of it — and his lithe, refined construction left some open questions regarding his personal inclinations.</p>

<p>He dodged another strike from Sbar'n, this one laced with fire. <em>Maybe you were built to be a cook,</em> he thought. <em>You do love cooking.</em> That, despite never getting to taste his creations.</p>

<p>Swirling under Sbar'n's heavy arms, he ducked between his legs and popped up behind the man. <em>I wonder if my friends actually liked my food, or if they just pretended.</em> Ven had eaten in a stormcloud of silence… but that was just Ven, he supposed. She'd gone out with that Lyrandar friend of hers. Jab wondered if something they'd discussed had bothered her.</p>

<p>Brim had nodded and smiled and made a rather big show of enjoying the meal. Jab was again stymied in discerning the truth. Was she placating him, or simply expressing her typical enthusiasm.</p>

<p><em>How can I become a good cook if no one gives me an honest opinion?</em> he lamented, diving sideways to avoid a crackling ball of flame from Sbar'n.</p>

<p>If anyone would give him an honest opinion, it would be Snipe. The brooding mercenary had never even considered putting energy into placating others, it seemed.</p>

<p>Jab looked over to the side of the room where Snipe had been dueling another agent, then blinked, his senses sparking. It took him a split second to see the outline of Snipe's body crumpled to the ground. He turned back too late to stop the blow from Sbar'n flashing across his temple. All went white.</p>

<hr />

<p><em>Work the problem,</em> Ven thought, crouching behind the set of crates and barrels that were slowly being burned, exploded, or cast away during the fight.</p>

<p>She'd sent Cinder scampering forward toward the device, knowing her fox could vanish and reappear over short distances. But while three of the four agents — including Sbar'n from the airship battle before — had launched into combat with her friends, one had stayed behind to guard the metallic sphere.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, this individual — who wore a high-collared duster that was considered out of style even when Ven had been a denizen of Sharn — appeared to be their resident telekenetic. Every time Cinder got near, or, for that matter, any of the fighting groups, he swept an imperious arm and shoved them ten or fifteen feet away.</p>

<p>She could feel innately her strange flaming companion could not take much more of that punishment before passing from existence. Thankfully, there was plenty of distraction. Brim, from behind her shield, was trading magical blasts with one of the agents, Jab was fighting Sbar'n, seeming to have little trouble dodging around the man's powerful, but slow, attacks, and Snipe… well, she hadn't seen Snipe in a while, actually.</p>

<p><em>He sure does know how to hide away</em>, she thought.</p>

<p>That was when she heard Jab cry out,</p>

<p>“Snipe!”</p>

<p>She jerked her attention over to Jab, who was looking over toward the corner of the room. There, she saw the slumped form of Snipe, his opponent stalking back towards the center of the room. With a sickening thud, she watched as Sbar'n capitalized on Jab's distraction to land a massive blow to his head, sending him tumbling to the floor.</p>

<p><em>Oh, Khyber Below,</em> Ven whispered. <em>This is a death trap</em>. She glanced over at Brim, near the edge of panic. Brim caught her eye from her own cover, then held up a hand as a tiny, ineffectual puff of arcana drifted off it.</p>

<p>Brim was dry.</p>
<h1 id="chapter-19">Chapter 19</h1>

<p>Ven stared at the carnage before her. <em>You're going to die here,</em> she thought, unbidden. But it wasn't wrong. Snipe and Jab were down, seemingly easily dispatched by their opponents. Brim was out of magic. Cinder couldn't get close enough to the device. Especially not now, with all four Tarkanan agents turning their attention to her and Brim.</p>

<p><em>Plus Mistress Tarkanan will probably appear at any moment,</em> she thought, helplessly.</p>

<p>She thought about calling on her fire, the smouldering heat within her that had been there since the Mourning. But she knew the agents, at least Sbar'n, were of fire themselves. She doubted it would be that effectual.</p>

<p>There was a part of her that already knew, in the back of her mind, what she needed to do. But she still rebelled against the decision.</p>

<p>It had been sitting there since the <em>Zephyr</em>. Etched into her shoulder, thrumming softly. <em>Power</em>. Similar to her wellspring of fire that she often cast, drawing from the pit of her stomach. But this was far, far deeper, an ocean of depths Ven couldn't begin to fathom.</p>

<p>That alone was reason enough not to use it.</p>

<p>She'd felt that since the airship as well. An anxiety, a nervous energy. The power from her mark felt as if held back by a dam, and if she opened it, she had no idea how reality would be reshaped in its image.</p>

<p><em>The power is yours, Ven,</em> came a thought, with a signature Ven now recognized as Cinder's. <em>You're not betraying yourself by using what you've been granted… plus, I really need to get to this metal ball thing, and we are shit out of options.</em></p>

<p>Ven spared a moment to consider the metaphysical implications of Cinder picking up swear words, but it was only a temporary comfort.</p>

<p><em>You're saving your friends,</em> she thought, steeling herself. Then she stood, stepping around the half destroyed crates that had been serving as her cover.</p>

<p>Three Tarkanan agents stood arrayed before her. The fourth was down, having taken the brunt of Brim's attacks as well as a few odd crossbow bolts from Snipe before he went down.</p>

<p>They clustered over the so-called dragonseye device in a V-shape. For a moment, everything went silent in the chamber, which was returned to the sounds of roaring applause, cheering, and stamping in the floorboards above.</p>

<p>Ven looked at the three agents wearily. Sbar'n stepped forward, grinning, fire alighting in his eyes and at his fingertips.</p>

<p>Ven raised a hand, and let the dam break.</p>

<p>\switchchar{*</p>

<p>Brim watched as fire erupted from Ven's hand. Not the small balls of fire she occasionally hurled, or the blasts she occasionally sent forth. Not the typical mix of oranges, whites, and reds that make up flame like that of her forges back home.</p>

<p>A column of pure red, nearly liquid-like in it's intense viscosity, instantly traversed the space between Ven and the Tarkanan agents. It promptly went straight through them barrelling through the crates and barrels behind them, then through the wall of stone in the plateau itself.</p>

<p>Brim droped her shield and raced forward, grabbing Jab's shoulders and pulling him away from the inferno. He had been, thankfully, just adjacent to it. While light burns covered his front, he appeared to have only been grazed.</p>

<p>The roar of the fire filled the chamber, sounding to Brim's ears like a forge being stoked to full tilt. Oddly, she didn't feel her face smarting from the heat, despite being only a few feet away. She could almost swear she could feel something singing within her, resonating with the cold, visceral energy after the blast.</p>

<p>It seemed to last a lifetime, but it must've only been a few seconds. Ven collapsed to her knees as the blood flames extinguished. She seemed alive, if spent, and held her head in her hands.</p>

<p>Before her, the bodies of the three Tarkanan agents were left as charred husks on the ground, stripped of most of their mass and burned through to hardened ash.</p>

<p>Incredibly, the dragonseye seemed to have incurred no damage, despite having sat squarely in the blaze. If anything, the interlocking metal strips seemed to have been polished to perfection.</p>

<p><em>In fact,</em> Brim thought, <em>I swear I can see red tendrils…</em> She jumped. <em>It's Starting!</em></p>

<p>She raced forward again, grabbing Ven by the shoulder and shaking her.</p>

<p>“Ven, snap out of it,” she whispered as loudly as she dared. Above, the crowd had silenced, and she had no clue if it was because of the noise of the blast, the end of the speech, or something else.</p>

<p>“We have to get this, Jab, and Snipe out of here <em>now</em>,” she continued, gesturing at the device. On the far side of the room, she saw that the column of flame had burrowed deep into the stone, carving a smouldering passage that looked to be several hundred feet deep.</p>

<p>Ven looked up at her, the hollowness in her eyes striking a strange fear into Brim. Her cheeks seemed gaunt, as if she'd lost significant weight. Her hands trembled in her lap. <em>Oh, Ven</em>, Brim thought. <em>What did you do?</em></p>

<p>She turned to try and at least move Jab and Snipe to safety before reinforcements arrived from above, but froze when she saw deep red tendrils snaking out from the dragonseye directly into her friends.</p>

<p>A moment later, they began to stir.</p>

<hr />

<p>Snipe had died. Or at least, he was pretty sure he'd died. Or was at the brink of death, certainly.</p>

<p>The thought didn't bother him; he'd made peace with the fact that his line of work would find him in such situations. But this was the first time he'd felt himself on the threshold.</p>

<p><em>I got played for a fool,</em> he thought, bitterly. <em>And by a teenager at that.</em> An arcanically enhanced teenager, but still.</p>

<p>He still struggled to figure out how the kid had kept getting the best of him. <em>It must've been magic</em>, he thought, though he hadn't seen the boy casting any spells.</p>

<p><em>Not now,</em> he jogged himself. <em>The dying, remember?</em> Right. The dying. He was — he was pretty sure. That was okay. He hoped the others got the dragonseye. But he hoped they didn't give it to Merrix. Or to Tarkanan. They should really just dump it off the city's edge into the Dagger River.</p>

<p><em>Focus!</em></p>

<p>It was hard to focus when there was nothing to see. He was vaguely aware that the cacophonous sound of combat had stopped around him, rather abruptly he thought, but time was fuzzy here. He wished he could see the battlefield.</p>

<p><em>You could've saved yourself</em>. He felt a calmness, a barrier holding back both the foreverdarkness and the panic of his approach to it. <em>You should've tried to use it</em>.</p>

<p>He shrugged, mentally. <em>I still don't know how,</em> he thought. <em>But hey, if it could've saved me then, why can't it save me now?</em></p>

<p>He felt a thrum, and in the dark space he inhabited, he saw a mote of red light ahead of him. By intuition, he willed himself toward it, and it grew larger as his consciousness approached.</p>

<p>The sparking, crackling ball of red energy floated before him, about the size of an egg. He cupped his hands around it, and could feel the energy beating within, but still didn't know how to access it. He could feel… almost a frustration from it. Like it felt the answer should be obvious.</p>

<p>He didn't know how long he spent there, focusing on the energy, trying to pull it into himself. He tried eating it — but his metaphorical teeth couldn't crack it nor could he swallow it whole. When he tried to move it, it only did so with heavy resistance, and left him with a vague, itchy sensation.</p>

<p>He had given up, “sitting” criss cross before the thing as the foreverdarkness slowly approached, encroaching in on his vision and sapping him of energy and will, when something new appeared.</p>

<p>It struck across his vision like red lightning, splitting into two channels that connected both him and the crackling ball of energy to the stream. He felt his consciousness arch as he was flooded with new sensations, like fire flowing though veins and breath exuding life itself.</p>

<hr />

<p>Snipe gasped awake on the floor of the cavern. Brim was above him, already tugging him toward a tunnel that definitely hadn't been there before… though he was admittedly still fairly disoriented.</p>

<p>As another moment went by, he felt strength flowing into his muscles. He stood, shaking off the disorientation, and surveyed the scene.</p>

<p>Ven was alive. She was lit from below by her fox, Cinder, standing in the mouth of the strange new tunnel. Jab was sitting up, holding his head, but moving to stumble toward the tunnel with Brim's help. He saw that Brim had tied the dragonseye to her armor and slung it over her shoulder.</p>

<p>He saw three husks of black on the ground. <em>Our enemies, presumably</em>, he thought. <em>Ven really has a fire affinity. You should keep an eye on her</em>. He eyed the tunnel, which seemed to be both in line with the husks and somewhat smouldering itself, as tiny flecks of ash drifted around the entrance. <em>That's insane,</em> he thought, and wrote off the implication.</p>

<p>He moved as quickly as he dared toward the tunnel, hoping not to drip, joining Brim and Jab, supported on her shoulder. But with each step, he felt his strength return, and by the time he was by Brim, he was urging them all forward.</p>

<p>Joining Ven, they raced down the dark tunnel as the sounds of footsteps sounded into the room. <em>Tarkanan,</em> he thought. <em>Finally realized her conversion ceremony wasn't going to plan.</em></p>

<p>He had no interest in meeting Tarkanan. From what little he knew, she held her position as “House” matriarch beause her aberrant powers were… significant. He had no doubt she would not suffer the fate of her acolytes if they faced her.</p>

<p><em>I hope this tunnel leads somewhere,</em> he thought, as the sounds of the chase echoed louder behind them. Cinder bounded ahead, providing both light and direction. Ven stumbled, seemingly in a daze, but Jab already seemed to be back to his former self.</p>

<p>Until they reached the end of the tunnel. <em>No!</em> Snipe thought. <em>It can't be a dead end!</em> They skidded to a halt at the stark wall of stone before them, where the tunnel seemingly petered out into crumbling rock.</p>

<p>Snipe spun around, looking back up the tunnel.</p>

<p>Mistress Tarkenen needed no light. Her body itself glowed lightly with an orange hue, her bright red hair flowing behind her. She wore stylish, but tactically viable clothing — a type of leather duster that seemed half robes, half tight mercenary vest.</p>

<p>Close behind her came three more acolytes. Their eyes burned with hatred; they'd seen the bodies in the chamber. Mistress Tarkanan looked serene. As they approached, Snipe felt the terror sinking in. He heard a voice to his right: Ven's voice, scratchy, and hauntingly hollow, but firm.</p>

<p>“Cinder, Now!”</p>

<p>The fox leaped up onto Brim's shoulder. She was standing in the center of their group, dragonseye held protectively in the crook of her arm.</p>

<p>Cinder yipped, and in a small burst of flame, Snipe felt reality constrict around him, compressing him into an infinite singularity before the pressure subsided and he tumbled back into reality in a dark alley just outside the warehouse.</p>

<p>His friends appeared with him, the fox looking somehow distinctly proud of its accomplishment.</p>

<p>But Snipe could only remember the last thing he'd seen inside. As Cinder had begun their teleportation, the acolytes leaping forward in response, Tarkanan had simply stood there. And Smiled.</p>

<p>Brim caught his shoulder to steady him, and the four haggard, beaten thieves ran off into the night.</p>

<h2 id="at-sea">At Sea</h2>
<h1 id="interlude-i">Interlude I</h1>

<p>The handmaiden to Matriarch Esravash Felarin Geyanai d'Lyrandar I, first of her name, sat hunched over a set of dusty, opened tomes. Each were lines with cramped text denoting the familial lineages of the twelve or so families that officially made up House Lyrandar. Sweat pooled on her brow; the storage room she had been stowed in had no windows, and the only light she had was provided by a single everglow lantern directly above the table at which she worked. It was mounted high enough that Chell had to lean over the books, squiniting closely — which then frustratingly blocked the light. She had a headache, and her spectacles keps slipping down her nose onto the books from the sheen on her face. She had been reading for ten hours.</p>

<p>The door to the room slammed open, sending her jumping nearly out of her seat. She cowed slightly as the smooth footsteps of Esravash brought the Matriarch around to the other side of the humble table, where she stood over Chell.</p>

<p>“Well, what have you learned?” It wasn't phrased as a question.</p>

<p>Chell swallowed, gathering her wits and her notes.</p>

<p>“Your Excellency, I've made it through all scions and cousins of the house amongst the twelve younger than the age of 50; all of the ones here in Stormhome, many of those spread around the continent.”</p>

<p>Her matriarch waited expectantly.</p>

<p>“All are accounted for thus far, Your Grace” Chell continued, looking down to avoid the withering gaze. “Are… are you sure it's not a foundling?”</p>

<p>Esravash dismissed her with a wave of her hand. “The traitor both had a mark of storms <em>and</em> an intricate knowledge of house affairs. That they even knew we <em>were</em> building it was a major breach, but they knew much more: <em>where</em> we were building it, guard details, operational guidelines.”</p>

<p>She paused. “No, this was an inside job. Keep working. If you run out of suspects, send inquisitors round to the families and start squirreling out any abandoned bastards and the like. Use gossip before intimidation, and do <em>not</em>, under <em>any circumstance</em>, give any indication of what the questioning is actually about.”</p>

<p>Esravash turned and strode purposely from the room, stopping at the door frame to look back with rage simmering in her eyes. “Find my ship, Chell.”</p>
<h1 id="interlude-ii">Interlude II</h1>

<p><em>In the darkness, they heard whispers.</em></p>

<p>One by one, Ven, Brim, Snipe, and Jab, exhausted, drifted into fitful sleep. Even Jab, usually ever-present, felt his consciousness slip to a distant, fuzzy place. None noticed the low bath of light, humming and red, sweeping through their apartments from the place within the walls they had torn open and mended over to hide their ill-gotten totem. The whispers tickled at their throats.</p>

<p>Jab found himself drifting back to <em>Precarious</em>, just after they'd escaped Tarkanan's warehouse. They'd all raced through the alleyways of the district, but had been trapped in <em>Callestan</em> when all the major bridges back into the central plateau had been shut down by the Sharn Watch. The crowd pushing to leave the district had been tense; he could feel it around him again, like a living thing, on the teetering edge of chaos.</p>

<p>“One at a time!” The Watch guard waved people forward, flanked by two spear-weilding partners, a third stepping up to search each individual breaking forward.</p>

<p>Tunics were lifted, clothes pulled aside unceremoniously, as the guard peppered each unfortunate soul with questions.</p>

<p>“Why were you in Callestan this evening?”</p>

<p>“Do you have any history of aberrancy in your family?”</p>

<p>“Do you know of the seditious activities underway in the district this evening?”</p>

<p>Jab approached the bridge within the crowd, whose angry yelling was growing by the minute. The large square was packed with people, some of whom had climbed atop a long collapsed statue to better shout things at the Watch holding the bridge. He recognized several from the marches down to the warehouses. Several, in front of him, had been discovered and carted off the square.</p>

<p>He stepped forward, double checking that the metal flap Brim had made him was covering his mark. With luck, they'd think it was just a part of his leg. They'd scouted every possible route, but the chasm between the plataus was too large. A bridge was the only way.</p>

<p>He glanced to the right, to a dark alleyway leading off the square, and saw her, red hair ringing a shadowed face, red eyes glowing. Smiling. He shook his head, and turned back to the guards in front of him, stepping forward nervously.</p>

<p>“Hey, Stop!” one called out, drawing a sword toward him. Jab froze. Looking down, he saw that from under the slat, red, viscous light was leaking out from his dragonmark. As the moments ticked by, his panic mounting, the film of energy surrounded him like a sheath.</p>

<p>He felt the impact as two of the Watch tackled him to the ground, trying desperately to reign in the energy. He felt, but did not truly see, the thump of his own body exploding outward in a red flash, sending the crowd around him collapsing in screams that turned from anger to pain. Everything went dark.</p>

<p><em>The mists stung</em>.</p>

<p>Jab took a hesitant step forward, then another. He could see the metal and wood of his arm beginning to corrode away under the piercing flow of the grey fog, almost liquid in its eddies and flows. The landscape was twisted and broken; ashen, unidentifiable shapes jutted and crested the scarred ground before retreating back beneath. No light penetrated from above, though the mists themselves appeared to illuminate their surroundings with some sick, hollow light. A negative light.</p>

<p>Gazing around, there was little to break the monotony of the desolation. A hill before him, or perhaps it was a remnant of a tall building. It shifted in the mists.</p>

<p>Jab kneeled down, running his hands through the ash. It was unlike that of any fire he'd seen. A small flower was pushing, struggling to cast aside the ash weighing it down. He brushed it off, and it burned his hands. It glowed, with that same negative light.</p>

<p>“You shouldn't touch them,” came a quiet voice next to him. Jab looked to his side, and saw a man kneeling in the ash next to him, the mists swirling between them. He had dark, curling hair, shorn at ear length. Where his eyes should be, empty sockets greeted him, each revealing the stalks for several more of the flowers, which bloomed in front of his forehead. More grew from lacerations in the skin on his cheeks.</p>

<p>Jab glanced down at his own hand, where blooms were beginning to push through the tendonous fibers of wood and metal that formed his wrist. Where they grew, they spread apart the tightly enwound elements of his form. It didn't hurt, though. He looked back at the man; his head was now nothing more than a skull, all traces of flesh picked clean. The flowers remained.</p>

<p>He stood, stepping away as the corpse thudded to the ground on its side. The dark shape before him in the distance shifted once more, now rising up through the mists, up and up, until its size could no longer be estimated. 200 feet? It shuddered towards Jab, and as the mists swirled and flowed around it, revealing it, Jab saw himself — or a reflection of himself, a copy, a <em>warforged</em>, only towering above him and the landscape. It turned to face him, and its eyes glowed red.</p>

<hr />

<p>Ven looked down at her blood covered hands, but it was not her blood. She stood with a Jorasco healer; before her on a makeshift table lay a villager. The sounds of battle could still be heard in the distance. Swords clanged and men died. When the winds changed, the smell of death enroiled the camp, and Ven staggered to keep to her feet. She was somewhere in the countryside, near edge of Cyre's lands.</p>

<p>The healer with her fell, she knew not from what. Every time she looked back at the villager, his wounds worsened, new ones appearing every time he left her periphery. She rattled through the healer's bags, looking for implements, gauze, even, anything to help the wounds. She kept seeing the salve she needed and grasping it, only to lift it up and find it was something else entirely.</p>

<p>She looked back at the man, but found not the villager, but the young pilot of the <em>Morning Zephyr</em>, charred and sliced open. She looked up and found herself at the helm of the ship. She could feel the skyship lurching downward into a near dive. She could see her companions hanging on to the railings of the deck outside, before being ripped off, one by one. She tried to control the ship, but it only dived faster. Her mark flared, draining her and sending arcing, jagged red lightning into the control rod. <em>It's not enough</em>, and down the ship flew, faster now, and her mark was flaring stronger, the floodgates open, the elemental ring of the ship screaming, the ground rushing up to meet her.</p>

<p>She woke up in a cold sweat, looking around wildly. A hand, dark, and calloused, found her shoulder.</p>

<p>“It's alright, Ven,” came the low, melodic voice. Owain smiled at her. “Just another nightmare.”</p>

<p>She sank back into the sheets of the cot she lay on within the small tent, a single flickering lantern providing low light. Owain moved from his kneeling position by the cot to a crouch, then made his way out of the tent. <em>Everything's fine,</em> she thought. <em>Just a dream</em>.</p>

<p>But everything was not fine. She grasped at the unease in clawing at the back of her mind, the hairs on her neck spiked up between bumps of gooseflesh. <em>Owain is dead,</em> she thought. <em>He's DEAD.</em></p>

<p>She threw off the covers, throwing a rough coat over her nightgown and raced from the tent, eyes scanning for Owain. She was at camp, the tents spread out in a circle, their wagons parked defensively on either side of the large fire, now smouldering in the morning light. <em>This camp was destroyed</em>, she thought, and spotted Owain halfway across the small field that held their camp, heading for the tall, proud forest at its edge.</p>

<p><em>The forest is death</em>.</p>

<p>Ven yelled, her voice hoarse and cracking, running forward as Owain didn't respond. She was halfway across the field when he disappeared between the branches. Her nightgown was ripping at the ankles, tripping her up and slowing her. She yanked it up to her knees to aid her sprint.</p>

<p>She burst into the treeline, the light of morning immediately sundered by the thick canopy, deep shadows painting the forest floor in blacks and browns and greens. She called out for Owain and heard no response. <em>The forest is death</em>.</p>

<p>Ven picked her way forward, over fallen branches and slick rocks, before glimpsing Owain up ahead. He was bent over, picking up branches and tossing some aside. <em>Firewood,</em> she thought, then felt a wave of heat run through her. <em>FIRE.</em> The briefest flash of an inferno grasped her vision, the forest around them alight. Owain turned around, and his eyes burned red. She blinked, and the forest was normal. <em>He</em> was normal.</p>

<p>She reached him in a flutter of fabric, nearly bowling him over as she grasped at him.</p>

<p>“Ven!” he laughed, hoisting her up. “What's gotten into you?”</p>

<p>Ven panted, catching her breath, catching his warm, woody scent. For some reason, it brought a tear to her eye.</p>

<p>“We have to go,” she forced out, once she could speak. She looked around wildly, searching for the threat.</p>

<p>“Go where?” Owain asked, setting her down. “We'll just be a minute, I'm just grabbing some wood for the breakfast fire.”</p>

<p>Over his shoulder, the morning fog snaked forward toward them, winding around the trees and splashing against their trunks. He saw her watching and turned, frowning.</p>

<p>“Huh, bit late for the fog to not have burned off,” he said. “Guess the canopy keeps the sun off.”</p>

<p>Ven felt her heart rate spiking again. She grabbed his hand, trying to pull him along toward the camp. He protested, but seeing the state of her, relented and began walking back, being tugged along but sticking resolutely to his plodding pace.</p>

<p>“Ven, you really gotta tell me what's going on. Did you dream something?”</p>

<p><em>The forest is death</em>. She didn't know how she knew. <em>The fog is death. No. Not fog. Mist.</em></p>

<p>She glanced back, and saw that the mist had risen, more of it sweeping in from deeper in the trees. It now rose to the tree tops, crashing toward them like a wave. As the mists passed over the trees, leaves and branches caught alight and burned away to ash.</p>

<p>Now Owain saw it. “Thriced Damned,” he cursed, grabbing her hand tighter and picking up the pace. “What is that?”</p>

<p>The two burst through the trees as the forest came apart in flames. Out of the corner of her eye, Ven could see animals, panicked, streaking out of the forest alongside them. She thought she saw a fox.</p>

<p>She could feel the mists stinging at their heels, burning pinpricks starting to singe at her coat, her ankles. They burst through the treeline and began sprinting back across the field toward the caravan. Pulled along by Owain, she risked another glance back. From here she could see that the wall of mist rose far higher than the forest, like a cliffside inching its way across the land, relentlessly. There was nowhere to go.</p>

<p>It caught them halfway across the field, crashing over them,  plunging them into darkness. There was nothing but the deep, infinite grey. She could feel Owain's hand in hers, but could barely see it. Her skin was alight in hot pain, like a thousand needles, her clothes were beginning to spark and catch flame.</p>

<p>“Almost there.” She heard the voice call to her, distant in the fog, husky through the mist, which felt like smoke in her lungs. She coughed.</p>

<p>She knew she was dying. They both were. She'd done it before. She tried, one last time, to call out to Owain, but only felt the hand slip from her grasp as she tumbled to the ground. For the briefest moment, the grass and dirt was blessedly cool against her burning skin, before she felt it melt off. 
The world flashed around her as she died, and with her last blink of vision, she saw a small animal leap across the space before her.</p>

<p><br />
<br />

<p>Ven opened her eyes, and before her, she saw the grand sweeping vista of the city of towers. She reeled from the transition; she now floated, incorporeal, somewhere away from the city, perhaps over the river. She tried to look around but could not; her view was fixed, as if watching a scene unfold in a memory. As she watched, the city before her blazed, crumbling and collapsing, the sounds of screaming just barely covering the rhythmic thumping of wings.</p>

<p>The Ring of Siberys, glittering and golden, arced across the sky overhead, the ocean below reflecting and refracting it like a sunset into a million twinkling shards. Ven glanced around. <em>This isn't Khorvaire</em> — at least, she couldn't imagine it was; the angle of the ring overhead was far too great.</p>

<p>It was, in fact, sunset, and as the star dipped below the horizon, the ring lit up even further, in brilliant, glittering glory. She squinted. There was movement in the sky. Not a bird. A moment later, another flit of movement, then another. As the sky darkened, it became unmistakable. Meteors, Siberys shards from the ring, began raining down, streaking overhead in brilliant fireballs. She craned her neck over to see where they were headed. Deeper inland somewhere. She looked back up to the ring. More were falling now. She'd never seen a shardfall before, but had heard of them. This seemed to be a big one. <em>A really big one,</em> she thought after a moment, as now the entire sky was alight with the streaking trails of the falling shards.</p>

<p>One struck a hillside near her, exploding half of its face away, clumps of dirt and rock raining down. She ducked, dodging debris, and felt the ground rumble beneath her. She looked up in time to watch a fireball lumber overhead, filling nearly half the sky. It dropped below her horizon. A moment later, A blinding white light cracked across her. She blinked it away, holding up her arm, and looked at the horizon to see a column of explosion rising into the atmosphere.</p>
