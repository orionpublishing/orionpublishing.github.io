Wow, what a fucking show. I was unprepared to to be thrown into a post-hardcore pit with nonstop moshing. I'm more or less too old for that crap, I'm sore everywhere.... but I got into it, somehow. It's been a long time since I've been sweaty and gross from jumping and being pushed about, throat completely hoarse from yelling. 

La Dispute sounded absolutely phenomenal, some of the best sound quality, mixing, playing, and performing I've seen in a long time. Incredible vocalist, and incredibly involved crowd, screaming all the lyrics. 10/10. Don't know if I could survive it again (but I'd go watch from the balcony).
