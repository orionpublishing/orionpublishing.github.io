<p>“And this is the war room,” Jaresh said, gesturing them into a long hall hewn in the rock face. The familiar sight of a map table filled its center, with a wooden carved surface depicting the islands of the Lhazaar Principalities in relief. More surprisingly, the islands themselves had little to no detail, yet swaths of the ocean were decorated with what looked like terrestrial features — forests, mountains, rivers.</p>

<p>“Interesting map,” Brim ventured, leaning forward to get a better look.</p>

<p>“Indeed,” Jaresh said. “Territorial power works differently in the principalities. Sure, the islands themselves have resources, but few principalities have the strength to fully settle and island and defend it. Our power rests in our fleets, and our fleets are most effective at sea, not sittind duck at port.”</p>

<p>Stepping around to the side of the table, Jaresh gestured to the ocean-bound features.</p>

<p>“To the unsuspecting, the ocean is just a vast, flat horizon. But for us, the seas around these islands are known for their games. Fleets service and protect trade routes up and down through the islands, and some routes are vastly preferable to others. One <em>doesn't</em> want to have to sail here,” he said, gesturing to a forest looking patch, “because the natural cavern formed by the mainland and this island forms a wind still zone in which thick fog often congregates.”</p>

<p>“And these mountains?” Brim asked, sensing Jaresh wished nothing more than to continue.</p>

<p>“Underwater mountains,” he responded. “Invisible at the surface, but often lethal to larger vessels. A region to avoid, or, if you're clever enough, to draw enemies into.”</p>

<p>It had been several long minutes since Ven had spoken, but Brim saw her frustration boil over.</p>

<p>“This is all well and good, but you've done nothing to explain how you intend to take on a twenty vessel fleet!” she exclaimed.</p>

<p>Jaresh only smiled rougishly.</p>

<p>“Love you, sister, but I can't go showing my cards at a critical juncture like this. Mother could have you spying for Esravash! And I don't know your friends.”</p>

<p>Ven groaned, grumbling into silence. Jaresh held up a placating hand.</p>

<p>“Okay, how about a taste. Look here.” He pointed down to the bean-shaped island that marked Orthoss.</p>

<p>“Es is bringing her fleet here. She means to anihillate us in open combat. How would you respond to that?”</p>

<p>Ven rolled her eyes, but Brim could see the spark of strategy swimming behind them.</p>

<p>“I'd uh… spread my fleet around? Force her to split up her own fleet? But that still leaves several of her vessels to each of yours.”</p>

<p>Jaresh nodded. “Yes, a good start, but not complete. And that plan would leave Blackrock undefended — Es could take it hostage and hold my citizens hostage.”</p>

<p>“How's your long range weaponry?” Snipe asked from the other side of the table. <em>Figures,</em> Brim thought. <em>He'd like this game</em>.</p>

<p>Jaresh smiled knowingly. “Continue that thought.”</p>

<p>Snipe paced forward, pointing to the many coves and inlets that lined Orthoss and its neighboring islands.</p>

<p>“I'd do as Ven said, split the fleet, but not spread them to the winds. I'd hide them in all these coves. Close enough to Blackrock to come to its aid, or provide some cover, but far enough apart that her ships can't rely on brute force.”</p>

<p>“Excellent,” Jaresh clapped his hands. “We know this terrain better than anyone. Esravash is relying on overwhelming force, but that is only viable on an open battlefield. We'll be fighting from the shadows.”</p>

<p>Brim was still troubled by all this.</p>

<p>“Doesn't she have airships, though? And more than you? She can root out the location of your ships from above, attack them from out of their range…”</p>

<p>“Yes, the airships are a thorny issue,” Jaresh conceded. “But I assure you I have a bit of an ace up my sleeve on that front. Ah, here she is now!”</p>

<p>They all turned to see a dark skinned figure with familiar braids and halter top stride in.</p>

<p>“Ah, the gangs all here,” Vys said brightly. “Long time no see.”</p>

<p>Brim gasped, catching herself. Ven looked like an anvil had hit her, while Snipe smirked annoyingly from the other side of the great table.</p>

<p>“What the hell are you doing here,” Ven stammered.</p>

<p>“I owe your brother a favor,” she replied lightly. “Like many others, he brought me a valuable piece of lore. But rather than gold or silver, he asked for my aid at some point in the future. And now he's cashed it in.”</p>

<p>“What exactly can you do?” Brim blurted, before hastily adding “Sorry- I just mean, if you deal primarily in lore…”</p>

<p>“No offense taken Brim,” Vys smiled. “Suffice it to say, I do have some talents outside of academia — though my records of past battles have not been unhelpful, I think.”</p>

<p>“Es gets here tomorrow,” Jaresh said, bouncing on his heels. “If you all stick around, you'll see Vys's talents for yourself. For now, you'll have to trust that I have things under control.”</p>

<p>Ven stepped toward Jaresh. Brim could read the fear, the unspoken history of pain in her eyes.</p>

<p>“It's not just about logistics,” she said, pleading. “Solia says Es will stop at nothing to put your head on a spike. It's <em>personal</em> for her. And… it goes beyond a vendetta. The Korth Edicts are being broken. A sovereign Principality is being invaded. Lyrandar agents may kill or capture members of your Deneith bodyguards, stacking an interine house war onto a reignition of the <em>Last War</em>. Is one airship really worth all that?”</p>

<p>She reached out and gripped his forearm.</p>

<p>“Leave the airship. Retreat with your fleet. You know these waters. If she <em>still</em> chases you, you have every right to fight back, and every principality will come to your aid, the houses will take your side. Her only <em>legal</em> justification here is the recovery of stolen property—”</p>

<p>“Stop,” Jaresh cut her off. “You have no idea what the <em>Sunrise</em> is worth.”</p>

<p>“I understand that an airship gave you the ability to build a fleet–”</p>

<p>Jaresh pulled away from her grasp, his expression darkening.</p>

<p>“One day, soon, I will show you why you don't understand,” he said, “but right now, you either need to trust me, or leave.”</p>

<p>Silence hung in the air for a long moment, before Vys clapped her hands.</p>

<p>“I'm starving,” she said brightly. “Let's all eat!”</p>
