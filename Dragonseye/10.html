<p>For better or worse, they’d crash landed in a bit of a no man’s land, a stretch of tower edge that didn’t really belong to any district. It meant there were fewer prying eyes, but provided few bearings to tack to. Snipe knew they’d overshot where the other skycoach had crashed, so he began leading the group inward and back.</p>

<p>He felt himself falling to the front of the group — he was, after all, the only one of them who’d lived and worked anywhere in the lower city. He glanced at his three companions, all of whom, for various reasons, were walking completely wrong for this part of the city. Ven, too jumpy, always looking around, Jab taking it in like a tourist. Brim… well, her size made her hard to ignore anyways, her near-seven foot frame and wide set shoulders — not to mention blue skin — was not going to be subtle anywhere.</p>

<p>If he was being honest, Snipe felt a little out of his depth as well. It was a testament to Sharn’s size that being from the “lower city” gave him only a passing understanding of how to behave and navigate down here. But he had little knowledge of this district; he was more or less as clueless as the rest of his companions.</p>

<p>Slowly though, the nondescript neighborhood of primarily storage spaces, shoebox apartments, and warehouses gave way to a true district — one he recognized instantly.</p>

<p>“We’re in Downstairs, guys,” he said, pulling his hood up over his head as they emerged from a side street onto a bustling thoroughfare lined with everglow lanterns, taverns, and theaters. Ven, he noticed, followed suit, pulling a pointed hood over her half-elven features.</p>

<p><em>Okay, so we’re in Lower Menthis then</em>, he thought, feeling a bit more at ease triangulating their location within the city.  Downstairs was a rowdy district, but Snipe knew there were some hidden gems tucked away, mostly fine restaurants that required squeezing into a secret back room of a burlesque theater or crowded tavern.</p>

<p>He scanned the crowd, trying to find anyone who looked out of place or nervous — the usual sweep. It would be hard, here, though, as plenty of visitors to the city, particularly poorer visitors, spent time carousing in Downstairs.</p>

<p>He was starting to lose hope when he saw a shock of orange out of the corner of his eye. Darting his gaze toward it, he felt a smile creep across his face. At a streetside food vendor, maybe 200 feet ahead of them, a half-orc woman, with ash gray skin and a braided pleat of vibrant, orange-red hair, was leaning on the counter and, it seemed, haggling for some street meat.</p>

<p><em>Gotcha,</em> he thought. Snipe had tailed his fair share of shady individuals over the years, and was always shocked at how quickly they’d return to their standard routine after thinking they’d shaken a tail. He’d sometimes even deliberately make his presence known, then pull back after the mark’s second or third evasive move, to give them the sense of security. He quickly dragged his group over to the side of the street.</p>

<p>“Got something?” Ven asked, eyes still darting uncomfortably around the neighborhood.</p>

<p>“Yeah, clocked em. Up ahead, 200 feet—DON’T LOOK” he whispered furiously as Brim, Ven, and Jab immediately turned to see.</p>

<p>“People can sense eyes on them, I swear,” he continued, trying to soften his tone. These folks were not used to this game.</p>

<p>“The four of us are going to be way too easy to spot,” he said. “You all should step into a tavern for a minute. I’ll tail them until they end up somewhere, and then come get you. In the meantime, make a plan for what we want to ask them and  how we’re going to subdue them.”</p>

<p>He didn’t wait to hear any arguments, and slipped seamlessly into the foot traffic of the district.</p>

<p>Snipe moved through the crowd like it was water. He moved neither too fast nor too slow, and even occasionally stumbled as if slightly inebriated, though mostly the stumbles only served to help him duck below eye level if his mark happened to be looking around. 
It was, he realized, the first time he’d been truly alone with his thoughts since he’d stepped aboard that ill-fated airship several days ago. It was the first time away from the strange little group he’d found himself in since arriving with Sharn, too.</p>

<p>The piercing thought crossed his mind of simply bailing now. Walk right past his mark, past the district, and disappear into the city, leaving all this nonsense with Dragonmarked houses and assassination cults behind. He worked better alone, anyway.</p>

<p>Their group had come together to survive — and yes, he admitted grudgingly to himself, he wouldn’t have gotten off that airship without them. But did they really need each other anymore?</p>

<p><em>Don’t forget the two thousand galifars,</em> he thought. He knew that would be his next thought, and he tried to shove it away. <em>Come on Snipe,</em> he chided himself. <em>You always said some jobs weren’t worth any amount of money.</em></p>

<p>Two thousand galifars was a lot, though.</p>

<p>As he drifted through Downstairs, he could feel the slight thrill through his body that always came with the work. It was satisfying to do something well. He traced the orange-haired half orc through several short stops, occasionally even overtaking her to break the cadence. At times, he pulled his hood down, at others, he took his coat off entirely. Anything to ensure she noticed no pattern.</p>

<p>He remembered his first jobs — he was his own boss then, just an orphan dodging through streets like these, but he’d already had a knack for pickpocketing hapless tourists. His foster parents were kindly; he never told them about those early exploits. But by the time he revealed that he had made entry to the Deathsgate Guild, he figured they knew anyways.</p>

<p>Soon, the woman with the orange hair made her way into a large, open square. It was crowded, but Snipe elected to hang back, preferring not to be caught out in the open. On the opposite side stood the Diamond Theater, a circular wooden building out of place in the metal and stone of the city, as if it had been dropped into the square from above. Its signage shimmered above the large, multi-door entrance, a glimmering holographic gem that sparkled in the low light.</p>

<p>As Snipe leaned against a lamppost and watched the woman pick her way across the square, he had to admit to himself that, near death experiences and aching body aside, it was a little refreshing to be on a job that might actually give him some personal answers. Money was great, but after a while it got hard to put your heart into a job if a shiftily-passed envelope would be the only resolution.</p>

<p>He didn’t know how much he cared for d’Cannith’s speech about powering the city and terrorist attacks — it all read like a classic “do the right thing” call to action and he very much doubted any head of a dragonmarked house would have a vested interest in the “right thing.” If Merrix was offering them two thousand galifars to recover this device, that meant it was worth much, much more than that. Still, he couldn’t deny that he now bore an actual dragonmark — and not a welcome one. He’d not yet really tried to “use it,” the way regular dragonmarked folk evidently did. It was unclear what, if anything, his mark was useful for. But he knew it held power —  he had felt it thrumming, just in the background, ever since he woke up on the airship.</p>

<p>Snipe broke from his thoughts when he realized he’d lost sight of his mark.</p>

<p><em>Shit,</em> he thought.* Stay with it! *</p>

<p>He climbed up slightly on the lamp post, surveying the crowd near the entrance doors, before catching that orange hair again over to the right, as the figure traced the perimeter of the building. About a quarter of the way around its circumference, she stopped, and vanished into a small door in the side of the venue.</p>

<p><em>Service entrance,</em> Snipe thought. *So she either works at the theater, or the theater is a cover for this group. *</p>

<p>He waited for a few minutes, to see if this was another quick in-and-out stop, and satisfied she was not emerging, returned to retrieve his ragtag party.</p>

<hr />

<p>“Sorry, did he say subdue?” Brim, perhaps naively, had thought her days of tying up prisoners and questioning them had started and ended on the Morning Zephyr.</p>

<p>“Well…” Ven replied, sounding it out and seeming fairly uncomfortable herself, “if this person’s part of the same group as the people who attacked the airship, then we have to assume she has similar capabilities. And would gladly use them on us.”</p>

<p>Brim swallowed, then noticed her throat had dried up considerably. She raised a hand and tried to make a motion to the bartender of the tavern they’d wandered into to indicate she wanted a drink. The burly, tattooed individual behind the bar frowned slightly at her, but seemed to get the message and started pouring her something.</p>

<p>“What did you order?” asked Jab, ever interested in mixology. 
“No idea,” Brim replied. “Whatever he wants me to have, I guess.”</p>

<p>Ven looked deep in thought.</p>

<p>“Something on your mind?” Brim asked. It looked like several things were on her mind, but Ven only nodded her head slowly.</p>

<p>“Sort of,” she said, searching for the words. “I’m a little worried that we’re letting Merrix use us as, well, basically locate-item detectors for the dragonseye… but after what it did to us last time, who's to say it won’t unleash something even worse on us when we get close to it again? What if we trigger it to explode, like Merrix claimed to be trying to avoid?”</p>

<p>Brim nodded. She’d considered that, but was more interested to see Ven evidently admitting — at least, implicitly — that she’d manifested an aberrant dragonmark. Brim had seen her mark of course; Ven’s clothes half burned away aboard the Zephyr and it was visible on her upper back when she’d learned to fly the ship. But it had seemed, for a while at least, that she was refusing to acknowledge it, outwardly attributing her abilities to her fire affinity.</p>

<p>At that thought, Brim felt a pang of pity for the half-elf. She didn’t really know the details of what Ven went through to end up with fire casting and a fiery animal companion, but it struck her that it was possible Ven had been through not just one, but two life-altering traumatic experiences. She made a mental note to handle Ven’s past with some extra care.</p>

<p>It was all a bit much — on the airship, fighting off the attackers, saving each other’s lives… she’d felt every bit their equal, or at least not stopped to think about it. But since arriving in Sharn, she’d gotten the distinct feeling that she was something of a country bumkin dropped into a complicated web of politics and dynastic families and money that she didn’t understand in a way that Ven and Snipe seemed to.</p>

<p>At least Jab seemed out of the loop as well — though it didn’t seem to bother him much. He was a weird one, that fellow. She was just about getting used to the disconcerting way in which he managed to emote without actually having any moving parts on his face.</p>

<p>When she stopped to think about it, just about everything she’d seen, from the airship onward, should’ve completely blown her mind. <em>Maybe it is,</em> she thought, <em>and I’m just too busy worrying about not dying to notice.</em> She felt the exhaustion in her bones, the weariness of what felt like a marathon of activity.</p>

<p>“Well,” Jab said. “I think it’s clear that I should not be responsible for tying this person up, if it comes to that. My efforts last time did not go very well.”</p>

<p>That actually brought a hint of a smile to Ven’s face.</p>

<p>“You know, you tried your best,” she said. “How could you have known he’d be willing to roll off the edge of the ship?”</p>

<p>She sighed.</p>

<p>“When it comes to subduing them, I might have one or two… more arcane methods at my disposal,” she spoke softly, almost regretfully, but Brim’s mind flashed back to the very dangerous looking spells Ven had thrown out in the cargo hold of the airship.</p>

<p>Maybe Ven saw her expression, because she cringed slightly.</p>

<p>“Not like those, hopefully. I mean I can hold a person in place, momentarily, or put them to sleep.”</p>

<p>“Oh, that’s handy,” Jab replied. “My method of putting people to sleep usually involves them forming a large bump on their heads.”</p>

<p>He thunked his spear into his forehead plate to demonstrate. “You fleshy races sure are bruisable.”</p>

<p>“Don’t like that terminology for us at all,” Ven shuddered.</p>

<p>Jab shrugged. “I don’t necessarily like ‘warforged’ as a name either, but sometimes we just don’t get to choose…”</p>

<p>Ven inclined her head to him in acknowledgement, and after a moment, quietly said,</p>

<p>“Yeah. I can definitely relate to feeling like you can’t choose your life.”</p>

<p>Brim took a sip of her drink, feeling it burn down her throat. Her parents would be scandalized, she thought, ruefully. Obsidian had warned her that the outside world would be a bad influence, that she shouldn’t venture so far. Not after what happened to her brother.</p>

<p>But there was nothing to be done. Khorvwares had decimated the business of their small, family forge. Hundreds of years of community had been chipped and etched away by the influx of cheap goods from the company’s new factories near Xandrar. Her father specialized in high quality work. He’d taught Brim how to forge in a way that didn’t permanently destroy the local environment; they weaved elements of nature into and through the pieces they made.</p>

<p>They still got commissions, for fine swords and rapiers, or ceremonial shields. But those were few and far between. The daily traffic of folks from Shavalant had dried up. Her father had even stooped to taking his wares into town and going door to door, facing the townsfolk whose families had been buying their wares for generations.</p>

<p>But mostly they turned him down, shaking their heads sadly. The Last War had brought tough times for everyone, and at least for the moment, wares of her father’s quality were considered a luxury.</p>

<p>Brim laughed into her drink, a single bark that surprised her in its bitterness, when she remembered that her whole purpose of coming to Sharn was to seek out the owner of Khorvwares and ask him to not sell in Shavalant. How far-fetched that thought seemed now. She’d seen enough, just wandering through this city, to know no one would be doing her family any favors.</p>

<p><em>Then again, you met Merrix d’Cannith</em>, she thought. Cannith owns the licensing rights used by Khorvwares. <em>And Merrix promised you a meeting.</em></p>

<p>Maybe, just maybe, if they pulled off this task, recovered the dragonseye, he would force the Khorvwares owner to do the right thing. She wasn’t asking much, she thought. Just leave one town alone. She took another sip, and this time she savored the burn.</p>

<p>When Snipe returned, Brim had a light buzz going. She felt strong, and the light thrum of energy that seemed to pulse through her forearm from her mark felt more alive, somehow. Snipe led them through the winding streets of Downstairs, where Brim, after some coaching, attempted to slump her shoulders and blend herself into the crowd.</p>

<p>It half worked.</p>

<p>When they arrived at the Diamond Theatre, Snipe pulled them all into another tavern, one with a view of the front of the venue.</p>

<p>“I think our best bet is to split up,” he said. Brim felt a wave of nerves rustle through her. “I’ll go in the service door outside, pretending to be staff. I can pick the lock. You all should get tickets and enter through the front, where you’re not likely to be suspected. Someone should check out the interior space and see if anything fishy is going on, while someone else can come to a service door and meet me.”</p>

<p>“How would we know which door?” Brim asked. Snipe rubbed his stubbly chin for a moment.</p>

<p>“Brim, let’s say you’re joining me backstage. After entering the lobby, find any door on the stage-left side of the theater. We’ll be within 120 feet of each other, and I can get you a message to figure out which door you’re at.”</p>

<p>Brim raised an eyebrow.</p>

<p>“Useful trick,” she said. Snipe shot back a decidedly wolfish grin.</p>

<p>Ven, Brim, and Jab peeled off from Snipe and entered the line of theater-goers queuing at the entrance. Dropping a the five-sovereign entry fee into the hands of the burlish bouncers out front, they found themselves stepping into a lobby richly adorned in felts of deep red and blue.</p>

<p>“This is a pretty nice theater for being in the lower city, isn't it?” Brim asked, turning to Ven.</p>

<p>“Sort of,” Ven replied, also looking impressed. “Lower city doesn't automatically mean poor. Some of the most exclusive restaurants are in this district. It's just… closer to the fringes where more dangerous people and groups do their work.”</p>

<p>Peeking through the main doors, Brim could see a large wooden floor where patrons who'd paid the standard fee were beginning to stand, holding spots for their companions off buying ales. Around the perimeter, raised seating was serving more privaledged guests, though many of the seats were still empty.</p>

<p>“I don't see any sign of our friend,” Jab said.</p>

<p>Brim looked around the lobby, her height easily a head above most of the theatergoers.</p>

<p>“Me neither,” she said. “I guess we should try to find a door and wait for Snipe.”</p>

<p>At this point, however, several ushers wearing the theater's sharp, deep blue suits emerged and began corralling the crowd into the theater. Brim looked to Ven, questioning, but Ven could only shrug back as they were shoved into the auditorium with the rest of the guests.</p>

<p>As they staked out a spot near the edge of the crowd, Brim whispered,</p>

<p>“How do we get back out?”</p>

<p>Ven pointed to tunnels leading out the side of the main theater floor.</p>

<p>“I think those might be our ticket. Washrooms maybe? Surely they don't trap people in here for hours with no washrooms, right?”</p>

<p>“Can't relate,” Jab said cheerily.</p>

<p>“Okay, I guess I'll try to go over in a few minutes and see if I can hear him,” Brim said uncertainly. As she did, the lights in the theater dropped, and a cheer went up from the standing crowd as lanterns on the stage burst alight, stringed instruments in a pit to the side beginnng to frenetically bow.</p>

<hr />

<p>Snipe heard the cheer of the crowd faintly through the walls of the theater, and gathered the show was about to start. He'd easily picked the outer door of the theater, but found himself in a well-trafficked backstage hallway that seemed to wrap around the back half of the circular venue. He'd had to duck constantly into storage rooms and behind piles of stage props to avoid being seen, as he lacked the peculiar outfit they wore.</p>

<p><em>I wonder how orangehair got in,</em> he thought, diving frustratingly into a side room as three more staff scurried by. He'd never be able to search the place effectively at this rate.</p>

<p>Looking about in the dim light, he found himself in a costume room, with racks of unused clothing shoved unceremoniously into the corner. He gave them a pass over, and was not immediately thrilled by any of the options, most of which were rather garish and comical.</p>

<p><em>But if it gets me back stage…</em></p>

<p>To his delight, a better option presented itself as he found a crumpled up version of the theater suit in the corner. Trying not to think about how it got there, he quickly changed, and stepped much more confidently out into the main hallway.</p>

<p>His breath caught as the first pair of staff ran by him — a disguise, he knew, wasn't everything, and he was relying on this place having enough regularly rotating staff that he wouldn't be recognized by face as an intruder.</p>

<p>But with the production underway, it appeared all hands were on deck, and everyone he saw was jogging purposefully to their tasks. 
This left him blissfully free to begin peeking in doors, picking locked ones, and overall having his way with the place. He found mostly further storage, along with a few offices. As he wrapped around to nearly the back of the venue, he saw a set of stairs leading downward, to the area under the stage.</p>

<p><em>Interesting</em>, he thought, stepping down.</p>

<p>He made it four steps before he nearly collided into the orange-haired figure bounding up the steps towards him.</p>
