<p>Brim let out a long whistle.</p>

<p>“Hey, uh, I think we might not be able to play our cards as close to the chest as we imagined.”</p>

<p>As the others looked at her quizzically, she held out the small note she had been palmed.</p>

<p><em>“I know what’s happened to you in the skies. About the… change. You aren’t safe. Talk to no one. Come to the Lightsbridge Tavern at 10-hour. – An ally.”</em></p>

<p>Brim could hear the small smatterings of curses being uttered under breaths, particularly from Snipe and Ven.</p>

<p>“It seems impossible to me that someone could know about all that,” she said, “Only people aboard the ship could have possibly known.”</p>

<p>Ven nodded gravely. “So this note is either from someone with extreme powers of surveillance, or it’s a trap, and it’s from the people who attacked us.”</p>

<p>“What would they want with us now?” Jab asked. “They presumably got the thing they were there for… that dragonseye thing?”</p>

<p>“Loose ends,” Snipe said with a low growl.</p>

<p>Something about that didn’t sit quite right with Brim.</p>

<p>“Whoever this is got us this note, right?” she began, sounding out her thoughts. “So they have power within the Sharn Watch, and our attackers didn’t seem like they’d have that kind of sway. If they did, they wouldn’t need to attack the airship, they could just smuggle the thing off it somehow.</p>

<p>“And why would an attacker invite us to a crowded place like a tavern in order to kill us? If they knew we were here, right now, presumably they could take us out at their own discretion.”</p>

<p>She shuddered a bit at the thought, but noticed a thoughtful look from Ven.</p>

<p>“I think Brim’s right,” Ven said. “Or at least, whatever’s going on, this note, delivered this way, doesn’t seem like the style of the people we fought. So…”</p>

<p>The question hung unspoken in the air for a moment before she concluded, “Are we going?”</p>

<p>Snipe still looked unconvinced, but Jab nodded slowly.</p>

<p>“I think for all that’s happened, we’re currently in the dark about a lot of things. Whoever wrote this clearly has information. If we can stay safe, we might learn something that helps us moving forward, even if we don’t volunteer anything ourselves.”</p>

<p>Brim looked around the group, and realized in a sudden rush that she was absolutely starving.</p>

<p>“Do you think… we might have time to eat some food before?” she asked.</p>

<p>Almost in response to the question, she heard the growling of stomachs and the sheen of hunger crossed her companions’ faces. They were all beaten to hell, and food sounded incredible.</p>

<p>“I know of Lightsbridge, though I’ve never been inside,” Ven said. “It’s in Upper Menthis. There’ll be plenty of other taverns and streetcars selling food up there. We’ll need a skycoach to get there though, there’s no way in hell I’m walking the bridges in this state.”</p>

<p>Brim nodded, not entirely sure she understood the majority of what Ven had just said. Ven noted the confusion and smiled slightly.</p>

<p>“Sorry. There are five main quarters in the city, for the five mesas. We’re in Central now, the others are Menthis, which is like, theaters and taverns and entertainment, Dura, which is mostly merchants, Northedge, which is residential, and Tavick’s Landing, which is a mix.</p>

<p>``We’re also in the upper city right now. The character of each quarter changes from upper to middle to lower, in the way you might expect. At broad strokes, you can locate a place by tagging it as I did — Upper Central, Middle Menthis, etc. There are also neighborhoods within each… but don’t worry about that right now,” she trailed off.</p>

<p>Brim nodded, filing away the information and noting that Jab had actually pulled a small notebook out, and was jotting down these tidbits in real time.</p>

<p>“There are some bridges that connect the quarters at most levels,” Ven continued. “Those are free, but take forever to navigate to and from and if you fall…” she made a long falling gesture with her fingers. “Skycoaches are probably the best way around, albeit pricy.”</p>

<p>Brim heard a knock at the door, and Mia poked her head in once more.</p>

<p>“I’ve gotten rid of those Watch detectives for the evening,” she said, with a cadence that indicated she’d done the same before. “Ven, Solia is going to want to speak with you, but she’s out of the enclave on business tonight. I can of course have your room set up—”</p>

<p>“No, thank you,” Ven broke in. “I have a place elsewhere in the city. But I’ll be sure to stop by to see… her… in the coming days.”</p>

<p>Brim thought Mia looked a little hurt at this, but accepted it in stride.</p>

<p>“Very well. If it’s alright, then, I do have some work to do and would kindly ask you to vacate my office. I’ll have more to ask about the airship situation in the coming days, but for now, it looks like you all could use a hot meal and, like, 72 hours of sleep.”</p>

<p>With a small chorus of thank yous and goodbyes, the group made their way out of Mia’s office, back into the central areas of Lyrandar tower. Exiting via a massive arched doorway, Brim’s eyes quickly accustomed to the night view of the city. Before them was a massive, bustling city square — the open air to the stars above indicated they must be in the upper city — and around its perimeter, entrances to 13 towers. Hundreds of city-goers traversed the large space, and a variety of food carts and entertainers dotted the square at regular intervals.</p>

<p>“Those are the other dragonmarked houses enclaves,” Ven said, begrudgingly taking on the role of tour guide. “Most of the business of the enclaves is actually held below, in Middle Central, but most upper city folk will enter dragon towers here before heading down.</p>

<p>Brim heard a small grunt from Snipe.</p>

<p>“Yeah,” he confirmed. “I grew up in Sharn too… never really came to the upper city at all, though.”</p>

<p>Brim turned to him as they began walking, Ven scouring the sky above for coaches.</p>

<p>“You said you worked for a guild right? Death something?”</p>

<p>“Deathsgate,” he confirmed. “It’s less macabre than it sounds, it’s named for the neighborhood it’s in, over in Middle Tavick’s, which is right above the city of the dead, Sharn’s graveyard. But the name fits — most of whom you’ll find there were soldiers in the war, and they do the jobs the Clifftop Guild would turn its nose up at.”</p>

<p>Brim slowly began trying to piece together all this new information, realizing in waves that this city was like a nation in and of itself.</p>

<p>Up ahead, Ven threw up a hand and a small burst of arcane light spiraled up from it like a beacon. Spiraling down from above, what appeared to be a long, slender rowboat, albeit sans oars, drew up beside their group. Sitting in the back, a young halfling, looking barely older than a child to Brim, peered at them.</p>

<p>“Where to?” they asked, with a strong accent that made the phrase sound like “Ehr, tui?”</p>

<p>“Upper Menthis,” Ven said, climbing aboard. The rest followed suit. As Brim pushed off the ground to step up into the coach, she felt a strange turn of gravity beneath her feet, as if she were suddenly much lighter. Her trajectory into the coach had a graceful arc, but she had overcommitted, and nearly fell over the other edge of the coach before Jab grabbed her arm.</p>

<p>“Ayee, first time!” came a gleeful exclamation from their pilot. Brim felt her cheeks grow a little flushed.</p>

<p>“Don’t worry,” Ven said, attempting a smile but mostly looking tired. “It’s the manifest zone. The reason Sharn could be built so tall, the reason the skycoaches work, is that we’re sort of… sharing overlapping space with the Syrania plane.</p>

<p>“Usually you don’t notice it, but if you put your awareness to the superposition, you can temporarily find your physics controlled by Syrania. It happens more often to magical folk, or when interacting with things like skycoaches that are doing this continuously.”</p>

<p>By now, they’d departed Dragon Towers and were soaring up above the city. Several of the spires still extended above their altitude, but the majority of the city was below. Much like their airship — Sovereigns, was that today?  — a delicate foil at the front of their skycoach left the air relatively smooth and still despite their speed.</p>

<p>“Do you know Lightsbridge Tavern?” Ven asked the pilot. After a split second of his hesitation, she shook her head and said “Just drop us at Morgrave.”</p>

<p>They continued winding through buildings, over and under long, spindling bridges, and finally burst out onto a sudden, yawning chasm.</p>

<p>“We’re between the plateaus now,” Snipe said, looking somewhat trepidatiously over the edge of the coach. Brim tried to look, but the dark, mile-deep depth seemed, somehow, much more foreboding in the tiny rocking form of their skycoach.</p>

<p>Soon, though, they re-emerged over the cityscape again. The upper city of Menthis Plateau was at a slightly lower elevation than Upper Central, and already the change in character was clear — music was audible from numerous directions, colorful sparks of magic, fireworks, and large magically illuminated signs danced off the sides of various towers. There was more open spaces created here, where indoor taverns and theaters spilled out into rowdy tables and impromptu casinos.</p>

<p>After a few minutes of taking this in, the skycoach narrowly threaded two buildings connected by numerous bridges, and emerged into the most open space Brim had seen in this city thus far. On one side of this massive square, an ornate, domed building with a fancy columnated facade stood proudly over the rectangular space; behind it, several connected towers with their own smaller domes rose toward the heavens.</p>

<p>The square itself was greener than most, long hedgeways and greenery had been planted, leaving it looking like a loose maze. Toward the other end of the square, a massive theater, with gracefully curving archways stood, patrons currently milling about its front.</p>

<p>All around the other edges of the square, large taverns with outdoor tables vied for real estate into the square proper, and Brim could see that extending behind the large theater was a whole neighborhood of what appeared to be nothing but food and drink establishments.</p>

<p>“Welcome to Upper Menthis,” Ven said as the skycoach alighted just above the square. They hopped out, Ven tossing a few sovereigns to the driver. “That’s Morgrave University over there,” she said, pointing to the massive domed building and it’s towers. “Not the best university in the world, but one of the biggest. Mostly they learn to go steal shit from Xen’drik and bring it back to ogle over and sell… I mean study.”</p>

<p>Brim made a mental note of this, then turned to follow her companions through the crowded, colorful streets of Sharn.</p>

<hr />

<p>Jab looked on as Ven wound her way through the street ahead of him. Up close, it turned out that while the majority of these streets were lined with dive bars and taverns, there were also a surprising number of small theatres and burlesques tucked between them. Patrons seemed to flow seamlessly between the two forms of entertainment.</p>

<p>Taverns were always a strange experience for Jab. He enjoyed the people watching, and the few he’d been in, though much smaller and quieter than these, were good places to practice his speech. But he had no need (nor ability) to consume food or drink, and found himself feeling often left out of the fun in such locales. Not to mention the odd sensation of watching others slip progressively into inebriation in real time while remaining sober.</p>

<p>Perhaps that’s why he was so interested in cooking. For as most of his short life, he’d had an urge to cook, or make drinks — anything to be a part of the overall experience of dining. So far, he’d been… not particularly successful. Not being able to taste  your own creations put a pretty hard limit on how quickly he could learn.</p>

<p>He found himself wondering if perhaps these new friends would sample some of his food and give him feedback. 	 Were they his friends? The thought splashed almost innocuously across his mind. He’d never had any reason to think of anyone as unfriendly before, and so far, that had gotten him to where he was just fine. And these folks had just saved each other’s lives, more or less. And the marks, he felt himself thinking, almost unprompted, with a tingle in his quad where the new dragonmark throbbed ever so lightly.</p>

<p><em>What was that about?</em> he wondered silently, itching to talk about it with the group but knowing, somehow, that this was still a bad idea. Maybe their mysterious contact could tell them more.</p>

<p>The Lightsbridge Tavern was a rollicking establishment located — obviously, in hindsight — upon a large thoroughfare bridge connecting two towers in the district. The wide bridge had festive, sparking lights passing down its center, and a steady thrum of people walked its length, stopping to peruse the shops and stalls lining its edges. In the center of the bridge, seemingly unsupported from below, the tavern jutted out over the expanse between the towers.</p>

<p>Jab could see three levels of seating, all on open balconies that looked out over the space between the two neighborhoods. The place was packed.</p>

<p>“Ugh,” he heard Ven groan from the vanguard of their party. “All tourists.”</p>

<p>Jab exchanged a sheepish look with Brim, knowing they were both soaking in the place with a fair amount of apparently undeserved awe.</p>

<p>Ven, ahead of him, squared her shoulders and seemed to gather herself, before powering through the crowds towards the door of the tavern. After they made it inside, Ven leaned over to him and yelled over the din,</p>

<p>“You’re taller than me, can you see anywhere a little less crowded to sit?”</p>

<p>He began searching, subconsciously filtering out the noise of the place to aid his focus. He sensed vibrations in the floor from around him, and above, and then turned back to Ven.</p>

<p>“I think we might have more luck on the balcony of the floor above! There seem to be less people.”</p>

<p>His instincts were correct, and before long, the group had nestled into a corner of the top deck at a small circular table.</p>

<p>“It’s around 9-hour now,” Snipe said. “So anyone who wants to eat or drink, do it now. We don’t know what’s gonna happen after that.”</p>

<p>It was a bit of a wait, but a barmaid eventually made her way over to the table, listing off a set of food specialties they were serving that night, and putting in a pitch for their “world-wide famous cocktail, the Featherfall.”</p>

<p>“Yes,” Brim responded, nodding. 
“Yes to…”</p>

<p>“To everything you just said,” Brim responded, seemingly confused.</p>

<p>“Ah… okay then!” The barmaid wandered off as Ven groaned again.</p>

<p>“Brim, do you have any idea how much that food’s going to cost at a place like this?”</p>

<p>Brim looked suddenly nervous.</p>

<p>“Oh no! I’m sorry. I’ll totally pay for it! And share with the group of course!”</p>

<p>Ven just shook her head slowly.</p>

<p>Jab, meanwhile, stood up and looked out across the tavern to where the bar was located. He wanted to see how that featherfall drink was made.</p>

<p>“It’s definitely not their thing,” Ven said, noticing him stand. “But it’s popular for visitors to the upper city. Every tavern up here claims to have invented it. It’s not bad, actually.”
Taking this as permission, Jab wandered over to the bar to watch the drinks get made.</p>

<p>“You need something?” said a gruff, elderly looking dwarf from behind the counter.</p>

<p>“Nope! Just watching,” Jab responded lightly, pointing at his face, which lacked a mouth.</p>

<p>The dwarf grunted in response.</p>

<p>“Fine, just stand back from the bar so you’re not taking a paying patron’s seat.”</p>

<p>From this vantage point, Jab watched the bartender mix several ingredients together — he begrudgingly revealed a few of them to Jab after he prodded, which Jab noted in his journal — before dropping a small token into the bottom of the tall, novelty-shaped glasses. Satisfied, Jab returned to the table.</p>

<p>“What are the tokens in the drinks?” he asked.</p>

<p>“Feather fall tokens,” Snipe responded. “One time use, stops you from plummeting to your death if you stumble off of one of these upper bridges. as many who consume that cocktail are wont to do. It’s almost like a game.” 
“Does it make you fly?”</p>

<p>“Nah, just makes you fall slow enough that you won’t get injured wherever you do end up landing.”</p>

<p>As he considered this, the food Brim had ordered began arriving at the table. A ridiculous mishmash of dishes, local and exotic, hot and cold, enticing and… questionable, were stacked high on their table.</p>

<p>Brim, after another slightly embarrassed look around the table, dove straight in, devouring food at a rate Jab found almost concerning. Snipe, he noticed, also dove in — he tried to make it look more casual, but he ate with the efficiency of someone who didn’t ever know when their next good meal might come. Ven, meanwhile, barely poked at it.</p>

<p>As it neared 10-hour, the tension between them grew, and early conversations — mostly Brim asking questions about Sharn — died down into silence. The food was mostly gone (sovereigns above that girl could eat), their wounds and aches from their battle still calcifying. They needed rest, and this brief moment of silence, before whatever this meeting would bring, was the closest thing they’d had to it all day.</p>

<p>And suddenly, he was standing at their table. He’d approached with an unnerving degree of stealth, especially so given he appeared to be a 90 year old man, with a shock of white hair, combed back over his head, and a quaint but sharp, formal suit adorning him.</p>

<p>“Hello. My master thanks you for agreeing to meet him, and wants to reiterate that it is of the utmost importance, both for your own safety, and for that of this city,” he said in a clipped accent, lowering his voice for the last phrase and prompting the group to lean in.</p>

<p>“I am Alain, and it’s my pleasure to bring you all to a more discrete location. I’m sure you have questions, and I can assure they’ll all be answered soon. I’ve taken care of your tab, so if you’ll follow me?”</p>

<p>The man turned to begin walking through the tavern. Uneasy, but shrugging at each other — this was what they came for — they followed Alain, winding between tables, and down two flights of stairs until they were on the bottom balcony of the tavern. To the side, Jab noticed several skycoach mooring platforms had actually been built under the Lightsbridge, with patrons disembarking directly into the tavern. Clever, he thought.</p>

<p>Moored at one of these platforms was a skycoach unlike any he’d seen so far. Unlike the open-top, boat like coaches, this was a sleek, black, enclosed vessel, with a door and small stairway extending down from it to the platform. Gold inlay filigree danced around its darkened windows, and it had no driver that Jab could see.</p>

<p>“If you please,” Alain said, gesturing to the carriage.</p>

<p>“So, your benefactor is uh, loaded,” Snipe said, as they climbed aboard the carriage. He looked the most visibly uncomfortable Jab had seen him yet. The enclosed space of the coach didn’t seem to be helping.</p>

<p>“Suffice it to say that money is not of concern in organizing this endeavor,” Alain responded, cryptically.</p>

<p>The coach took off, soaring out and above the tavern they’d just patronized. Even the ride was smoother than expected, without the light buffeting and rocking the smaller coach had suffered. Jab felt his altitude sensors rotate and flex, and knew before looking out the window that they were climbing, steeply.</p>

<p>“I thought we were already in the upper city,” he mused, to no one in particular.</p>

<p>“Yeah,” Ven said quietly, looking out her own window and craning her neck upward to look at something he couldn’t see.</p>

<p>“We were. But there’s one part of the city higher than that… the Skyway.”</p>

<p>“Indeed, Ms. Ostler,” Alain said, and Jab noticed that Ven visibly startled before attempting to cover up her surprise. <em>Why is she nervous about her last name?</em> Jab wondered.</p>

<p>“We will be heading to a private residence in Skyway so as to draw the least amount of unwanted attention,” Alain continued.</p>

<hr />

<p>Ven swallowed, hard.* Who were these people?* She was still jarred by Alain’s use of her married name, particularly given that she took that name as a homeless medic travelling through the peasant countryside with a bardic troupe. No one had reason to know that name, if they knew her at all.</p>

<p>And a home in the Skyway? Only the wealthiest of the wealthy — not just of Sharn, but of the continent — could afford property in the floating network of towers that hovered, impossibly, above the city of towers itself. Whoever they were meeting had an immense degree of influence. Ven found herself growing increasingly concerned that she was wrapped up in something much bigger than just House Lyrandar… but being stuck between some other powerful entity and her own house was almost worse than discovering her own house’s shady dealings.</p>

<p>The private skycoach soared ever higher, until the windows went dark, the city lights below hidden behind a shroud of misty clouds. And then they were through, several moons above casting glinting light down onto the glittering mansions of the Skyway. She watched as they circled around the back of one such tower — in all honesty, one of the least garish and gilded of the lot — before coming to rest in a small courtyard.</p>

<p>Alain opened the carriage door, the steps extending down to the ground via some arcane, or perhaps mechanical, mechanism. One by one, the party filed out, and arrayed before a small, innocuous door, prepared for whatever awaited them inside. With a small wave of Alain’s hand, a mechanism within the door clicked pleasantly, and it swung open.</p>

<p>Stepping inside, Ven immediately smelled flames, and as her eyes adjusted, found herself directly in a large, circular library. Books lined the walls of the tower as high as she could see, and a massive, roaring fire filled a fireplace on the opposite wall. A winding, double helix staircase led up the walls to give access to more of the shelves, and the center of the space was arrayed with fine rugs, comfortable sofas, chairs, and tables, with low lights oriented for study.</p>

<p>As they all took in the library, a man stood up from one of the chairs by the fire and turned to face them. Ven felt a wave of recognition and panic flow over her in waves, and she clenched her jaw tight to keep it from falling open. She glanced at her companions, but the rest did not seem to recognize him.</p>

<p>“Hello, all, and thank you for coming,” he began, in a soft, light Brelish accent. “Apologies for all the cloak and dagger, but my involvement in this matter is rather sensitive. Ah, my manners — I’m Merrix d’Cannith. Would you care to introduce yourselves?”</p>
