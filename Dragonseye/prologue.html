<p>The Morning Zephyr through the air over Khorvaire, clouds slipping by as the small crew tended to the airfoils and elemental ring of fire coursing around the ship. On deck, in a covered and windowed pavilion, the ship’s several passengers lounged at a few small tables, having just completed their noontime meal. It was somewhat odd that the Zephyr carried any passengers; it was registered as a transport vessel to Khorvwares Inc.  after a brief retrofitting in the wake of the Treaty of Thronehold, and had none of the luxuries of the gilded House Lyrandar vessels now revolutionizing travel.</p>

<p>In fact, the contract that Oryn Hass, the captain of the <em>Morning Zephyr</em>, had signed for the cargo in his hold explicitly forbade the onboarding of  passengers. But when the Zephyr had to make an unexpected landing in Starilaskur due to mechanical troubles, Hass couldn’t resist the urge to sneak a few paying passengers onboard to pad his own pockets.</p>

<p>It was an eclectic group, to be sure. Most familiar to Hass were the two shadowy, hooded figures who spoke little and passed him their gold with the appropriate degree of subtlety for anyone hitching a ride in a transport airship. They kept to their quarters for much of the journey, emerging only for meals. Less roguish, but equally reserved, was the half-elven woman who boarded with a small, ever-so-slightly iridescent fox bounding at her feet. As she negotiated passage to Sharn in Hass’s small quarters, he reckoned he had never met someone paying so much gold to get somewhere they clearly, desperately, wished not to go.</p>

<p>More excited about this potential journey was the large, blue Firbolg toting a heavy, intricate shield. She didn’t… strictly speaking have the galfiars Hass would charge, but she was so disarmingly persuasive, with such a comically charming and wholehearted belief in how inexpensive an airship journey could be, that Hass couldn’t say no. Good for a young lass to get out and see the world, he figured, before Sharn beat it out of her. And last, of course, the Warforged. What an odd egg, that one. Hass could hardly parse what the fellow was on about, but was perfectly happy to take his money.</p>

<p>Jab was the Warforged’s name…  and he did indeed carry a spear, though he didn’t seem to have a personality to use it. Instead, he spent his time roaming the ship and, at any opportunity, approaching the other passengers (and the crew) with pamphlets (literature, he called it), about some “Dragonmarked house” of Warforged. Hass didn’t deign himself an expert in the matters of the dragonmarked houses, but he certainly knew that Warforged — a construct-like species invented by House d’Cannith during the Last War, and only just awarded freedom and citizenship two years prior — did not bear the familial dragonmarks that had lifted the houses to their positions as titans of industry and culture.</p>

<p>That did not stop Jab from delightedly showing any and all his “dragonmark,” a crude-looking rune seemingly carved into the wooden panel of his shoulder with a penknife. No one seemed to have the heart to question it, though.</p>

<p>“Do you desire to learn the secrets of heredity and aging concealed from the warforged race? I invite you to join House Geneo! Learn to beget warforged children, and gain the mortality of the fleshy races!” Hass heard the slight robotic lilt drift across the pavilion. He could see the slight frown from the half-elven woman in response as she absentmindedly pet her fox, curled up in her lap. Stepping forward into the pavilion, Hass traced a small sigil in the air to amplify his voice with a minor Thaumaturgy.</p>

<p>“Attention everyone. Our Zil communicator has just made contact with Lyrandar Tower in Sharn and secured our berth there. We should be arriving in a few hours, just around sunset. I highly recommend being on deck at that time — the city at sunset is something to behold.”</p>

<p>As Hass finished the announcement, he noticed that the group of passengers — the woman, Venezia, the Warforged, Jab, the Firbolg, Brim, and the shadowy figure who went by “Snipe” — were not in fact looking at him. They were looking up, through the glass paneling in the roof of the pavilion.</p>

<p>He glanced upward himself, peering into the bright blue of the sky, and, narrowing his eyes, made out the speck of darkness above that seemed to be slowly growing in size. As several moments ticked by, feeling like years, Hass and his passengers watched as the speck resolved into a sleek, gray airship, hundreds of feet above them. 
Hass felt a tremor of fear shoot through him, the tales of air piracy in the Lhazaar Principalities playing at the edge of his consciousness.</p>

<p><em>But we’re so close to Sharn</em>, he thought. <em>It must just be another passing ship.</em> As he convinced himself of this, he heard a slight gasp from Ven, her fox glowing brighter. Focusing again, he noticed that a new set of specks, these ones black, seemed to have separated from the other airship, and were rapidly falling toward the <em>Zephyr</em>.</p>

<p>Slowly stepping back, he looked down at his passengers and tried to control the tremor in his voice.
“Please, uh, please head to your cabins. And lock the doors.”</p>

<p>With that, he turned and ran, cranking out the Thaumaturgy sigil again and booming out: 
“Crew to your stations. We are under attack.” As he continued to run, Hass heard the sound of the ship’s siren begin to ring, started by his pilot. He bounded up the ladder to the aft deck which housed the ships controls, and turned to glance back at the sky.</p>

<p>He turned just in time to watch, transfixed, as several streaks of fiery red light streaked out toward his ship from the rapidly descending specks, now clearly visible as black-clad humanoids. The streaks struck the forward deck of the ship before the figures did, fiery explosions ripping through the hull. All of the glass windows of the pavilion below shattered instantly, as the forward half of the ship went up in flames.</p>
