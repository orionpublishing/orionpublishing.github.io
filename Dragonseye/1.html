<p>Ven ducked down, shielding her face from flying glass and splinters as her fox yelped in surprise. She looked around, disoriented, as the heat of flames out on deck reached her face. Something within her stirred, at the warmth of it.</p>

<p>Across the pavilion, the others seemed to have survived as well, the large blue girl — Brimstone Malleary, Ven recalled her cheerily introducing herself — was holding her sizable shield up in front of her and Jab, the chattering Warforged, seemed to have leaped nimbly behind the table at which they had been eating meals.</p>

<p>She felt a flash of movement to her left, as the shadowy figure who she’d never actually spoken to darted back through the pavilion towards the stairs leading down to the cargo hold without a word. 
She didn’t have time to consider this further as on the flaming deck in front of the now torn-open pavilion, several figures made three point landings. They were clad in all black, but as they looked up, revealing their eyes through gaps in the veils, Ven swore she saw a tinge of red.</p>

<p>Suddenly, the ship lurched violently downward, tilting dangerously toward the ground. Ven looked nervously toward the damaged section of the elemental ring. While she’d left her home and her Lyrandar name behind before airships became common, she’d heard enough about their development to know the ring had to be stable for the ship to move.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, several crew members of the Zephyr had raced in towards the assailants, scimitars and rapiers drawn. As the ship lurched, one was flung into the air. Before Ven could react, she saw the tall, central figure amongst the attackers raise a hand, and seemingly with their mind, carry the airmen’s velocity forward, launching them over the edge of the deck and into the open sky. 
<em>Fuck, Fuck, Fuck!</em></p>

<p>Ven scrambled up, noting the other passengers around her were also jumping into some kind of action. Holding back the searing pangs of panic, she called out to Brim, who’d introduced herself as a blacksmith:</p>

<p>“Brim, the ring! We’ll fall out of the sky if that thing stays broken!”</p>

<p>Brim nodded a terse, frightened response, and began sprinting over toward the side of the ship where the beam out to the elemental ring was located. To her other side, a growl pierced her ears and she turned in time to see one of the quiet passengers, Snipe,  morph — shift — into a beast-like version of themselves, drawing a rapier and leaping forward.</p>

<p>As the flames licked higher and higher, burning away at the hull of the ship, Ven could feel the buoyancy of the soarwood begin to give way, gradually being eaten away by the flames. 
As she stared into the wall of flames, her mind tore back two years, to desperate sprinting through a dark, twisted forest, a wall of flame at her heels, a terrible mist roiling within it. The panic was truly setting in now. She shook her head, violently pushing it aside.</p>

<p>Before her, Snipe and Jab — who now actually wielded the spear that had before served only as a walking staff — had joined the skirmishes on deck, darting in with the ship’s crew to engage the attackers.</p>

<p>Ven was a healer, not a fighter. Seeking something helpful to do, she raced back through the pavilion, toward the stairs leading up to the cockpit of the ship, where the House Lyrandar pilot was likely fighting tooth and nail to keep the bound elemental within the ring, and the ship in the air. She didn’t have the dragonmark of her family, the Mark of Storms, so she couldn’t fly the ship herself. But she was knowledgeable enough about air vehicles. 
She got to the staircase just as two of the black-clad attackers did, coming around the deck from the other side.</p>

<p><em>Dragons below</em>, she thought, screeching to a halt as one of them turned to face her, blocking her path, gesturing the other one forward.</p>

<p>“There weren't supposed to be passengers,” the man growled, eyes piercing down at Ven with a now definitively red glow. “Certainly not ones who’d fight back. But I guess I can take out the little girl for sport.”</p>

<p>Ven felt the rage rising in her chest, something within her heating, literally, as flames began to spring from her palms. 
“I’m 29, you piece of shit!” She reached out, channeling the flaming energy towards him. He attempted to dodge, but not nearly quickly enough. Her fox spat a mote of fire at him for good measure.</p>

<p>“Dolurrh!” The man spun, slapping at his uniform to put out the flames, before turning back to Ven with a snarl. “So you’re fire affine are you? Well so am I.”</p>

<p>Ven scrambled as the man seemed to summon forth his own wellspring of fire from within himself, just dodging his swipe. She heard a scream come from within the cockpit above, as the ship lurched violently again, nearly throwing both her and the attacker off balance.</p>

<p>“I’m sure it still hurts!” she snarled back, slamming into him with another magical surge. Whatever it took, she knew she had to get to that cockpit.</p>

<hr />

<p>Brim peeked nervously out over the edge of the ship. Far below, the thick trees of the King’s forest beckoned, looking deceptively like soft green padding.</p>

<p>She looked out over the beam-like spoke that extended out from the side of the ship. At its end, one of the small channeling rings was damaged, twisted into an unnatural shape by the blasts, and was now passing into the path of the bound fire elemental that surrounded the ship in a ring. The point of contact was sparking and screeching as the elemental passed through the bent metal.</p>

<p>As she neared the railing, the din of the battle behind her seemed to recede under the roar of the wind and fire.</p>

<p>She knew she could fix it — or at least, bend it back into place, she had no idea if it was also magically busted — but to do so she’d have to climb out onto the 25-foot long spoke, with nothing but her grip keeping her from falling to a certain death. This was, Brim thought, not ideal.</p>

<p>It took the ship lurching one more time to spur her to take a deep breath and crawl out onto the beam toward the sparking connection.</p>

<p>The <em>Morning Zephyr</em>, as it turns out, was equipped with several magically enhanced  airfoils mounted around the front of the ship, responsible for redirecting air around the hull. As a result, the top-deck of the ship was generally a pleasant place to stand or stroll, even at full speed; the airflow over it was rarely more than a small breeze.</p>

<p>Not so out on the beam, where the full force of the Brelish sky now pushed against Brim’s rather large form as she scooted, inch by inch, further away from the safety of the ship. Somewhere to her right, a fading scream reached her ear as a blur descended away from the Zephyr. Brim kept her eyes locked on the spoke beneath her.</p>

<p>Hand over hand, her eyes tracing the grain of the wood and pulsing magic of the nexus channels, she made her way out the 25 or so feet between the hull and the elemental ring.</p>

<p>As she neared, she felt the intense heat of the fire elemental streaking past before her. It was, if anything, a comforting feeling. She had grown up in her family’s forge, and was an accomplished blacksmith herself. Fire she could handle. Heights were another thing.</p>

<p>She felt her hammer at her side; it had been bumping comfortingly against her thigh with each crawl out on the spoke. But as she arrived at the point of contact with the ring, she realized she wouldn’t be able to swing her arm without throwing herself wildly off balance.</p>

<p><em>Onatar help me</em>, she thought, reaching within herself to the small wellspring of magic that she had only ever used before to aid her enchantment of goods in a workshop. Thankfully, the magic came, and reaching out one hand, she released a simple mending cantrip, hoping it would be enough.</p>

<p>For a moment it appeared it wouldn’t, the spell being underpowered to bend the sturdy, now-akimbo metal. But with a second coaxing attempt — aided by the fact that the metal, as a result of it now intersecting the ring of fire, was growing hot — the ring slowly shuddered back into place, leaving the path of the swirling fire elemental free.</p>

<p>Brim sighed in relief, before immediately facing what now seemed like the most stressful part of all: getting back.</p>

<p>“Do I turn around or just back up?” she muttered, entirely unequipped to ascertain which was the more dangerous maneuver. In the end, she decided that she’d rather not back straight into the spear of one of the assailants on deck, and attempted a 180-degree rotation.</p>

<p>She turned just in time to see a chunk of some wood liberated from the pavilion in the explosions smashing in her direction, seemingly at the mental behest of one of the cloaked figures on deck. She ducked, but the motion threw one of her legs over the edge of the beam, and she nearly slipped off entirely.</p>

<p><em>Khyber!</em> she thought, immediately cringing at the disapproving gaze her parents would throw her for swearing. Reestablishing her grip, she lay low, hugging the beam with both arms and legs, waiting for any further projectiles.</p>

<p>After several tense, windswept moments — not helped by her vision occasionally being blocked by her own hair whipping in the breeze — she saw the figure turn, distracted by the rapier that had appeared seemingly from nowhere but was now in the immediate vicinity of their throat.</p>

<p>Murmuring a thanks to Onatar, she slowly shuffled her way back toward the deck.</p>

<p>*Is this really what the real world is like? * Her quiet home in the woods seemed already so very distant… but the fear and adrenaline of the attack mixed, ever so subtly, with the excitement and discovery of it all as well.</p>

<hr />

<p>Snipe leaped rapier-first into the fray with a feral pleasure, feeling the strength of his shifted form infusing his muscles. This was not by any means his first fight… though it was the first to take place on an airship, and one falling from the sky, and one that was on fire.</p>

<p>First time for everything, he thought. If he lived, it would certainly be a story for the riff raff of bottom-feeding adventurers at Deathsgate, the adventuring guild currently paying his way. Worth a few free  rounds of ale at least, he was sure of it.</p>

<p>Snipe wasn’t unduly concerned about the attackers; he’d seen plenty of black-clad, scurrilous folk in his time, and usually, the intimidating getup was more of a coping mechanism than any real tactical advantage. Tactical advantage was his territory.</p>

<p>Swirling fluidly through the sets of fighting crew and assailant, he picked his moments, waiting until an enemy levied their full attention on a strike before darting in himself and skewering them with his rapier. Quickly disengaging before they could respond, he’d flow to the next target, alternating stabs of his sword with bites from his now extra-long, beast-like teeth.</p>

<p>For a while, it seemed these attackers would go down like most he fought: before he did. But trepidation slowly creeped into his mind as he realized that these people knew what they were doing, and one by one, the crew of the Zephyr were succumbing around him. Soon, it was going to be all of them against him.</p>

<p>Something else was bothering him as well. Snipe was not inexperienced at reading people in combat. While several of the assailants had immediately fucked off to the other part of the ship, those here at the front fought without… purpose? He couldn’t put his finger on it, but he started to suspect this particular fight was nothing but a distraction.</p>

<p>Before he had time to examine this further, a stiff breeze knocked him — and near everyone else on the foredeck — clean off his feet. One crew member was lifted off and flew back through the broken pavilion. Snipe didn’t hear the thump of their landing, if there was one.</p>

<p>Taking advantage of the claws that were temporarily at his disposal, he dug into the burning deck and looked to the source of the wind, which wasn’t hard to find. The primary airfoil at the nose of the Zephyr was currently in flames and lilting to the side. Whether the flames were inhibiting the enchantment, or the angle was to blame, fast flowing air was now streaking across the deck.</p>

<p>Snipe crawled forward against the wind, feeling his stomach turn as the misdirected air seemed to be pushing the nose of the ship steeply down toward the ground. Reaching over his shoulder, he ripped his own cloak off — he’d been in enough tomb traps to have come by a fireproof one — and leapt the final few feet forward, simultaneously smothering the airfoil and also attempting to jam it back up in the position he remembered it being.</p>

<p>To his cloak’s credit, the fire was quickly extinguished. He hadn’t been entirely sure it was a genuine article, but made a mental note to find the dealer Erasus in Sharn and toss him a few extra sovereigns.</p>

<p>Less fortunately, the airfoil didn’t appear to budge, his strength not enough to fight the new pressure of the air going over it. 
“Need some help?” he heard from next to him, and turned to see Jab standing beside him. “I’m pretty heavy, so the wind’s not a big issue,” he offered, helpfully.</p>

<p>Snipe nodded, and together, they jammed their shoulders into the airfoil, heaving it back into place.</p>

<p>The air immediately calmed, and the nose of the ship bobbed upward, equilibrating at a roughly horizontal attitude. Snipe could still feel in the pit of his stomach that the ship was losing altitude, and realized that the buoyancy in the air was coming from the wood of the hull itself, which was now on fire.</p>

<p>“We need to put out some of these flames,” he called to Jab, “Not much more of this wood can burn or we’re fucked.”</p>

<p>Jab nodded, and with a remarkably thoughtful expression for a creature with no moving parts on their face, grabbed Snipe’s cloak, wrapped it around himself, and proceeded to fall over, rolling over the flaming deck. Snipe watched incredulously as large swaths of the flame peppering the deck winked out.</p>

<hr />

<p>Well this is fun! So thought the warforged as he rolled around on the deck wrapped in a scratchy, but surprisingly extinguishing cloak. He wasn’t very happy about the fact that these assailants seemed intent on knocking their ship out of the sky… but at the same time, he was sort of excited to have some new people to practice his House Digenio speech on. The other passengers on the trip had seemed pretty closed off to the idea of joining, but he knew he just needed a bit more practice honing the pitch.</p>

<p>As he rolled, merrily lost in thought, he cow tipped no fewer than 4 individuals — crew and assailant alike — who heard a congenial “Ooops!” as the rolling cylinder continued on its way.</p>

<p>Soon, the majority of the flames licking at the forward deck of the ship were extinguished. Jab could feel within his attitude-sensor — three small orthogonal vials of viscous liquid near the center of his chest — that the ship was no longer descending rapidly. They might need to drop some weight, but so long as no more of the wood burned, they would probably stay airborne.</p>

<p>Untangling himself from the cloak, he stood up to give a thumbs up to Snipe, just in time to watch him, and one of the black-clad attackers, go over the starboard railing of the deck. 
Well that’s not good! He ran over to the edge, not exactly sure what he would do about it, but hummed in relief as he saw both figures still technically aboard, albeit just barely hanging on to one of the large lower fins that ran along the bottom of the hull. 
It seemed reasonably stable down there: the fin wasn’t quite flat — it was angled at roughly 30 degrees downward — but if not for the wind would be perfectly standable.</p>

<p>Still, his new friend Snipe looked like he was struggling a bit to hang on. Jab’s processors quickly carried out a projectile motion calculation — first estimating the distance down, then incorporating the forward velocity and acceleration of the ship, then his own weight and any applicable air drag, and finally, in a brilliant touch, internally modifying the gravitational constant to account for the fact that in and around Sharn, the Syrania Manifest Zone lowered the force of gravity — and, satisfied with the converged solution, Jab leaped out over the edge of the ship.</p>

<p>Jab was blissfully unaware of almost all of this. Eyeing a spot next to where Snipe and his assailant landed, he jumped, enjoyed the feeling of weightlessness, and landed lightly on the fin. At least, as lightly as a 300 stone mechanical being could land. Stabbing may have been Snipe’s forte, but acrobatic maneuvers were certainly his.</p>

<p>As he landed, he turned toward Snipe, who’d already tussled the black-clad figure to the ground and given him a solid shove toward the edge of the fin. The figure tumbled end over end, desperately scrambling for any purchase, but the fin was constructed to be as smooth as aerodynamically possible. Robes half tearing off, they just managed to cling to the edge of the fin before being tossed into the sky.</p>

<p>Jab watched Snipe, claws securing him to the fin, stalk over toward the figure, and deemed the situation under control. Instead, he turned his attention to the back of the fin, where several flaps were tilted up at various angles, another mechanism for controlling the ship. They were also on fire. Holding out the cloak, he bounded over to the fins and began smothering those flames as well.</p>

<p>As the flames subsided, Jab turned to make his way, somehow, back on deck, and noticed Snipe (seemingly having disposed of the intruder) was pressed up against a window in the hull. Joining alongside, he pressed his face to the neighboring window to see what the fuss was about.</p>

<p>He could see the telltale bright streaks of offensive magic being cast before his forehead thumped the glass.</p>
