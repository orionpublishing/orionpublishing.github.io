<p>Mia Toradin d’Lyrandar walked with some trepidation through the quiet streets of Northedge, awkwardly clutching two bottles of wine in one hand. The other held a small note, with a scribbled address. It had been an exceedingly long day at the tower; the sun had set by the time her skycoach had touched down in the district.</p>

<p><em>Does she really want to talk to Solia’s right hand?</em></p>

<p>She pushed the thought away, glancing around at the variously visible address markers. A job was a job, and Mia was good at hers. Solia had seen fit to let her shadow negotiate nearly the entirety of the most recent contract with Arenal for soarwood, and according to Solia it was the best rates they’d negotiated in years. That didn’t mean she was Solia’s pet, desperately clinging to the severe woman’s coattails. The Toradins owed the Selavirs a debt. Mia’s service had little to do with personal inclination.</p>

<p><em>That’s not how she’ll see it.</em></p>

<p>Mia felt herself sweating slightly, whether from the hilly incline of the streets or her own nerves she wasn’t sure. She found herself wishing she had changed out of the crisp, but uncomfortable Lyrandar uniform before coming here. Actually, doubly so given who she was coming to see. Her steps grew slower as she neared the block that would contain the address she carried, the distance stretching like the gulf of years she had no clue how to bridge. She stepped up to the door and knocked, and immediately heard the scraping sounds of weapons being drawn within.</p>

<p>“Uh, Ven,” she called out, trying to keep her voice steady. “It’s Mia…”</p>

<p>The movement from inside stopped, and the door slowly opened to reveal Ven, suspicion in her narrowed eyes turning to confusion as she confirmed Mia’s identity.</p>

<p>Mia blushed, feeling somewhat sheepish with her bottles of wine. Glancing behind Ven, her strange new companions were gathered around a wooden table, seemingly in the middle of a take out meal… though one of them was, seemingly, working a small forge on their back patio? As the silence extended, Mia realized Ven was waiting for her to say something.</p>

<p>“I got your note at the tower,” she said, looking down. “I didn’t mean to intrude, but I thought since it’s been so long…”</p>

<p>She looked up to see Ven seem to ponder this situation briefly, before a small smile touched her lips, filling Mia with relief.</p>

<p>“I’ll be back in a bit,” she said over her shoulder to the others.</p>

<p>The dark, brooding one still stood hand on his sheathed rapier as Ven closed the door behind her.</p>

<p>“There’s a small park we’ve walked by a few times,” Ven said, gesturing up the street.</p>

<p>The small slice of green lined the residential street along one of the terraces of the district, with benches lining a low wall, offering a panoramic view of the lower terraces and, across the chasm, the central plateau. Mia sat down heavily, her breath puffing out in a small cloud of mist in front of her.</p>

<p>“Long day?” Ven asked, sitting down next to her.</p>

<p>“You have no idea,” she replied, pulling two simple metal cups from her bag. She handed one to Ven, and offered up the bottles for selection. “Both from my father’s estate, I’m afraid,” she said. “I’ve changed much since you last saw me, but not gotten any less of a cheapskate.”</p>

<p>Ven gave a short laugh, seeming to linger on the proffered wines. 
Oh no, she probably doesn’t want any, Mia thought, but eventually Ven selected one and allowed her to pour them into small tankards she’d brought in a shoulder bag. As they sat back, Ven stared out over the city, and seemed years beyond her age.</p>

<p>Mia reached a hand out to a low, bowl-like metal cistern that sat in front of them built into the stone. Waving her fingers, a small bonfire erupted in the bowl. It had a bluish, greenish tinge, with small little crackling bolts of lightning sparking out of it — nearly everything she could do magically was tinted with stormlike energy.</p>

<p>They sat quietly for a while, looking at the city, the gulf of the ten intervening years seeming to grow between them. Ven didn’t know what to say.</p>

<p>“Does Solia know you’re here?”</p>

<p>Mia smiled ruefully.</p>

<p>“No, she’s away right now,” she responded. “Doubtless if I’d told her, she’d have tried to turn me into a spy… You are going to have to see her though.”</p>

<p>“I know,” Ven said, quietly.</p>

<p>More silence followed, passing before them as if dragging behind the skycoaches that flitted across the skyline before them.</p>

<p>“I know you think that no one cared about you or noticed when you left,” Mia said, the words suddenly spilling out like an open tap, “but it’s not true. It was like a hole had been punched in the side of the tower. All of the staff felt it. Mariel felt it. I felt it. And I know you won’t believe it, but your mother felt it too.”</p>

<p>Ven stared out at the city.</p>

<p>“I’m sure she had an interesting way of showing it,” she said.</p>

<p>Mia sighed.</p>

<p>“Believe it or not, it was about the first time her actions weren’t inscrutable,” Mia replied. “For weeks, she stormed about the tower, ranting and raving and threatening to send a battalion to get you back. After Jaresh, I don’t think she could bear to lose another. And then she went silent. Kept to her rooms for weeks on end. I… basically ran the tower for a while.”</p>

<p>Mia scanned Ven’s face for a response, but she, like her mother, was characteristically stone faced.</p>

<p>“She knew where you were, though. Always,” Mia continued. “She uh… she had informants tracking you across the continent. She didn’t interfere because she thought you just wanted to forget it all.”</p>

<p>Mia was surprised to find her face growing a bit wet, a sheen over her eyes blurring the everlight lanterns dotting the city before them into a streaky abstraction. She felt a soft touch on her arm, and blushed again as she saw Ven reaching out to comfort her, for all intents seeming more like the older of the two, though Mia was several years her senior.</p>

<p>“I’m sorry, Mia,” she said. “I did need to go. And I don’t care about, or even support, most of what the family does. And I especially couldn’t go down the path Solia had set out for me. But it was still selfish. I left good things behind, too.”</p>

<p>Mia nodded and took a sip, finishing her tankard. She poured more. 
“You were a good  babysitter,” Ven said, and Mia laughed, the sound ringing around the park. It felt good to laugh.</p>

<p>“Yeah, I almost forgot. You were a nightmare,” she said through the last giggles, before growing thoughtful again. “You know, I was happy you got away. I was sad, but you were so terribly unhappy here. I think Solia may actually have realized, after you left, that for all her attempts to carve a world for you and your sister to inherit, she forgot to… you know, actually raise you. Actually see if you wanted it. I’m not asking you to forgive her. But she’s not the same woman anymore.”</p>

<p>Ven took a deep breath, and a tentative sip of the wine she’d been nursing.</p>

<p>“Do you know why she sent for me?” she asked suddenly. “If what you’re saying is true, I can’t imagine she’d send vague threats and summons just to get me to watch Mariel’s trial.”</p>

<p>“You’re right. It’s definitely not that,” Mia said. “ In fact, I doubt she’ll even ask you to attend, if you don’t wish to. But I don’t know what she needs from you. And I know everything, so if she didn’t tell me, then it’s highly classified. Ven, I promise you, she wouldn’t make contact if it weren’t critical.”</p>

<p>“Hmm.”</p>

<p>Mia knew that sound. It was the sound Ven had always made when she knew she was trapped into something she didn’t want to do. Mia’s heart ached to see the woman so torn up inside. She’d read bits and pieces in the reports, the horrible fire, Ven trapped so close to the Mourning… she shivered. She had no clue what exactly Ven had been through, but she could see in her eyes that she’d lost more than Mia could imagine. She reached into her bag, looking for something to cheer her up, and pulled out a stack of envelopes.</p>

<p>“Alyse wrote you letters,” she said. “We have a stack of them in the tower, which you can take any time, of course. Solia and her fought about it all the time; Solia was bitter, but wanted to respect your privacy. Anyways, this is one of the newer ones. Just thought I’d offer it.”</p>

<p>Ven took the letter, emblazoned with her mother’s seal, and its characteristically off-kilter stamping that resembled the attempt of a toddler in a hurry. She slipped it into her sleeve.</p>

<p>Mia knew that Ven's relationship with Alyse was nearly as complicated as that with Solia. She thought it was less overtly negative, but you never knew with Ven. Alyse was something of a free spirit — she'd spent most of Ven's childhood at sea, commanding part of the Lyrandar Southern Fleet. Mia had actually served under her, for a few years.</p>

<p>Those were fond memories. Alyse was the type of woman to throw herself into the see from the sails if the day was nice enough. Mia wondered, if Ven ever took a moment to relax, if she'd be anything like her mother.</p>

<p>“She'll be there, at the ceremony,” Mia ventured. Ven nodded, but didn't seem to register much. Something seemed… different about her. Not just the time past. There was a certain roiling energy about her. Vibrating just under the surface. As she examined her once-friend, who sat with hands curled into fists at her side, her small fox darted out from under the bench and lept into the cistern holding her Bonfire.</p>

<p>“Ven!” She called out instinctively, standing up and preparing a spell to put out the flames. But Ven only laughed, as the fox seemed to burst into its own orange flames, curling up in the blue-green fire.</p>

<p>“Okay… odd,” Mia said, siting back down.</p>

<p>“I know,” Ven replied. “I don't really understand it either. I thought I was going crazy for a little while, but as near I can tell, it's some type of familiar that's bonded to me.”</p>

<p>“It — they? — are cute,” Mia said.</p>

<p>“I decided it's a she,” Ven said, “and I'm pretty sure my deciding actually made it so. I think I might call her Cinder.”</p>

<p>The two watched as the fox perk its head up, wreathed with in the flames, and cocked it to the side. It seemed to glow a little brighter.</p>

<p>“I think she likes it,” Mia said.</p>

<p>She paused, trying to pick her words carefully.</p>

<p>“I don't know exactly what you're wrapped up in here, with those strange friends of yours,” she began, “and I'm not going to pry. But be safe, okay? This city always has its dangers, but things seem especially tense at the moment. I'm assuming you heard about the attack at the Diamond Theater?”</p>

<p>Ven sighed.</p>

<p>“Yeah,” she said. “… I'll try to be careful.”</p>

<p>“Good,” Mia replied. “I'd hate to see something like that happen to you.”</p>

<p>Ven seemed poised to say something else in response, then seemed to hold it back.</p>

<p>“The Houses are growing too powerful, Mia,” she said instead.</p>

<p>Mia frowned. It was a stance Ven had long held, one they'd discussed actively during their youth. She wasn't sure why Ven wanted to rehash it now. They'd never quite come to an agreement. At the same time, Mia now had a decade of experience rising through the ranks of House Lyrandar.</p>

<p>“… Maybe,” she ventured, cautiously, “I can see that some of the Houses, like Cannith, or Orien, or” — she winced slightly — “or Lyrandar, could be seen as holding too much sway in the politics of the five nations. But what of, say, House Jorasco? or Ghallanda? Do we not need hospitals or inns and taverns?”</p>

<p>“I'm not arguing that Dragonmarks are inherently evil,” Ven said tightly. “But if anything, House Jorasco is the <em>worst</em> of them. Imagine having the supernatural ability to heal others' ailments and to wield that power only for the highest bidders.”</p>

<p><em>They</em> do <em>have some free public healing houses,</em> Mia thought defensively, but she had to admit that Ven's larger point wasn't without merit.</p>

<p>“Healers need to eat too, Ven,” she said. “I see where your concern lies, truly, but I don't think there's anything wrong with charging at least those who can afford it for your services. It would be great to give it away for free, as you did in New Cyre… but not everyone has the privilege to do that.”</p>

<p>She regretted the words as soon as they'd left her mouth. Ven stiffened across from her, face darkening. <em>Shit, I've fucked this up. Again.</em> she thought. <em>She didn't even know Solia's hand was pulling strings to keep her afloat.</em></p>

<p>After a long silence, Ven finally spoke again, the words barely a whisper.</p>

<p>“So it's true, then,” she murmured, her words like ice. “I never really left Solia's grip at all. The mystery donations that kept the clinic running… the uncharacteristically stockpiled medical supplies… She was there the whole time. Letting me live out my little fantasy, until the moment she felt I'd had enough. And then, all it took was a threat to take it all away for me to come slinking back.”</p>

<p>Mia felt tears breaking at the edges of her eyes. She longed to reach out, to try to comfort Ven, but she knew she'd only be shrugged off, and that would hurt even more. She wished fervently that she could explain that it wasn't really like that… that Solia had realized she'd lost a daughter, and just wanted to make sure she could achieve her goals.</p>

<p>It wouldn't matter. Even with that intention, her interference, her unwillingness to let Ven truly leave her sight, to forge her own path… That's what Ven couldn't stand. And Mia had stood by and watched it happen for all those years.</p>

<p>Mia stood suddenly.</p>

<p>“I'm sorry,” she said. “I should go.” She turned toward the city, away from Ven, gathering her cups and the now empty wine bottles in embarrassment, hiding her use of her sleeve to wipe her eyes.</p>

<p>“Wait,” Ven said. Mia turned back, slowly. Ven patted the bench, shooting her a tired smile. “Sit down. It wasn't your fault, and I'm not about to rope the one true friend and confidante I had besides Jaresh in this blasted city into my web of animosity. I hope I can disagree with the House's motives and resent my mother for her actions without driving you away, too.”</p>

<p>Mia sat back down, slowly, the guilt still roiling in the pit of her stomach. <em>You can never tell her,</em> she thought.</p>

<hr />

<p>The two sat until the fire died out, exchanging a few more words. Ven reluctantly diverged a few details of her life as a healer in New Cyre, her travels with a bardic troop across Khorvaire. Mia relayed a bit about her time at sea — though not the raunchiest bits — and found herself venting uncharacteristically about her recent attempts to juggle multiple simultaneous contract negotiations with Cannith, Aranel, and the Zil gnomes, all of whom had essential contributions needed for the construction of an airship.</p>

<p>Ven, to her credit, nodded along and laughed at the right bits… but it soon became clear that her thoughts were churning somewhere Mia simply couldn't access.</p>

<p>As they stood to leave, the bonfire burned down to cinders, Mia instinctively embraced Ven as she always used to. She felt her old friend tense up, before seeming to melt into the hug. She felt thinner than Mia remembered.</p>

<p>“Thanks,” Ven said. “It's… been a while since I've seen a friendly face.”</p>

<p>“You may not see Sharn as a home, but you're always going to be family to me,” Mia said, trying to project, somehow, how she felt. She felt her face growing red again. “If you want me, of course.”</p>

<p>The implication seemed to strike Ven as she winced slightly. Her face softened, and she put a hand on Mia's shoulder as Cinder jumped onto her own.</p>

<p>“Of course, Mia,” she said quietly. “I'll… see you soon.”</p>

<p>Ven turned and walked away through the park, back toward her apartment and that strange crew of hers. Mia almost regretted not asking how she came to travel with them, but something told her she'd get very little in response.</p>
