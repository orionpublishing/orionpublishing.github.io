Kel stood on the small rise that bordered her village, and gazed up to the land of the gods. It stretched out above her, filling much of the sky, hanging like a reflection. Angels, in their chariots, streaked across twilight purple hues. 

One, she knew, would burn brighter than the rest. For when the god's realm hung close above their skies, so too came the deliverance Water, Food, Medicine. Support for the tribes. She tracked their progress across the sky, seeking where in the desert she'd seek the goods. Hopefully before the Seekers of other villages arrived.
