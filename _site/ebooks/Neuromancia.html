    <h1>Neuromancia</h1>
    <article><h1 id="prologue">Prologue</h1>

<p>Khalid stood at the threshold of the chamber in the heart of the temple, vibrating with nerves. But he hadn't given four years of his life to this con only to piss out now.</p>

<p>He stepped across and into the Valley of the Priests. The chamber was long as a city street, its sharply rising, outward-banking walls seating the hundreds of priests that made up the Cognozi. They each wore their robes up, hanging partially over their faces, each with an identical mask of pure white.</p>

<p>Khalid did not climb the grueling staircases to join the ranks of seated figures. He, and the other initiates who had filed in before him, were snaking straight down the valleys rough-hewn floor. Toward the altar.</p>

<p>There were fifty of them in all. More than two hundred had entered his class of initiates. Most were of families of middling wealth — ones who could send their children to the schools but not afford to sustain them forever. The priesthood offered the promise of a stable, enviable salary. The rich never joined the Cognozi.</p>

<p>Khalid did not come from one of those families, though he tried his best to conceal that from his fellow initiates. As the cullings had sent wave after wave home in shame and rejection, it became harder to hide that his knowledge was recently — and rapidly — acquired. It didn't much matter, because the more he interacted, the higher chance someone would grow suspicious. Best to keep to himself.</p>

<p>In neat rows of five, the initiates knelt before the altar at the end of the valley. Before them, seated thirty feet above the altar, sat the High Priests Cognozum. They sat straight backed, larger than life. Tight vestments hinted at bulging muscles rippling beneath. Each had a mask of pure gold, features carved into perfection. Unlike the Cognozi, theirs did not have eye, nose, or mouth holes.</p>

<p>Khalid eyed them wearily. Like many of the other initiates, his mind swam with the four years of grueling study he had completed — memorization of complex, intricate workings and designs, long tomes of poetry and descriptions of battles long ago fought.</p>

<p>For every other initiate kneeling around him, Khalid wagered this would be the crowning moment of their lives, the first in a long line of moments serving the priesthood. He did not plan to stick around. But he had to make it through the initiation. Had to make it through tonight.</p>

<p>None of them knew what it entailed. Rumors abounded, growing stronger and more terrifying within the ranks of the final year initiates. <em>Perhaps they shall tell us what it is we are to be priests of</em>, Khalid thought.</p>

<p>He quelled his thoughts as the High Priests stood, balancing their bare feet on thin ledges that supported only their heels. The Five stood regally in silence as their central member raised an arm.</p>

<p>“Today we will share with you the great secret of our empire, that you might join in its survival, its growth, and its legacy. You know that our empire is forged and our world shaped by the power to mold reality to our will. You know that this power expends memory to do so. That a man, once burned all their memories away, becomes a monstrous, animalistic thing.</p>

<p>“You have seen us, the Cognozum, work great wonders. And you, and all in this land, may wonder how we achieve such heights without destroying ourselves. Our enemies, and those domestic terrorists who seek to use such powers against our great empire, to tear it apart at the seams, they <em>especially</em> wish to know how, no matter how powerful they grow, we always crush them back down.</p>

<p>“We will tell you this secret, granted to us by the Radiant Host above themselves. The secret to all great neuromantic workings.</p>

<p>“The secret is you.”</p>

<p><em>Shit. What the fuck does</em> that <em>mean?</em></p>

<p>“We are as one the mind of empire,” the high priest continued. “We are as one the fist of justice, we are as one the builder of nations.” The assembled priests in the stands murmured, their chant echoing across the valley, repeating the high priest's words.</p>

<p>“All that is the empire sits within this hallowed Valley. To protect the peace, the prosperity, and the survival of this land, requires sacrifice.”</p>

<p><em>Shit, shit, shitting shit.</em></p>

<p>“We the high priests are but humble servants to our people. We strike down our enemies with the weight of an army. You will soon join the ranks of that army.”</p>

<p>Khalid resisted the urge to glance around at the priests sitting in the walls. How much of them was left?</p>

<p>“We ask of you to give yourself to the cause of this place. To give of your dreams and memories to ensure our land stays free. It is a great sacrifice, we know. But all present here have made it.”</p>

<p>“We are one,” chanted the priests in unison, the low rumble of their voices impacting the core of Khalid's sternum.</p>

<p>“We will care for you. You will live a long life. A good life. A life with meaning, purpose. A life with your needs met. We will not use more than is needed.”</p>

<p><em>Sure, right.</em></p>

<p>“And so shall you step forth to the altar, and forge a neuromantic link with one of us,” he gestured around him to the other four high priests. “Henceforth we shall be joined. We do not force this upon you. Any unwilling to give this gift may leave in peace.”</p>

<p><em>Fucking sure,</em> Khalid thought, <em>if it's the peace of floating face down in the Daanar river. But how do I get out of this?</em> His plans were collapsing around him.</p>

<p>One by one, the initiates stepped up to the altar and laid their foreheads upon the stone. In time, each high priest floated down, claiming ten of the fifty initiates each. Laying a hand upon their down-turned heads.</p>

<p>“To forge the bond, you must release a memory willingly,” the high priest boomed. “A strong memory. Think to your childhood, to the moment you first saw your mother. Think to her embrace.”</p>

<p>Khalid shivered. This was some absolutely fucked up shit. And it looked like he'd have to do it.</p>

<p>Some initiates squirmed and writhed under the forming bond. Some screamed. A few passed out, and were gently dragged away by attending priests. And then it was Khalid's turn.</p>

<p>Trying not to shake visibly, he stood and made his way to the altar, frantically flicking through memories he was willing to give up, yet knowing none would be sufficient.</p>

<p>His forehead touched cool stone, yet it felt like burning lava, icy hot, humming with power. It's surface was wet, slightly, from the tears of previous initiates. He could almost extend his mind out to grasp the power, and then the high priest was there.</p>

<p>The hand lay on his head, but he could barely feel it under the crushing weight of the high priest's will. It seemed to squeeze his mind, his whole existence, into the tiniest of motes.</p>

<p>He felt a voice, silky, insistent, growling. <em>Give.</em></p>

<p>He panicked, and in his panic he saw his father. Saw the man pick up the plate of fine tile and smash it across his mother's face, saw her collapse to the ground. The blood seeping on tile. His screams. His promises, to kill that vermin of a man.</p>

<p>And then he was gone.</p>

<p>Khalid blinked, his head rising from the stone. He couldn't tell if he'd been screaming… his throat felt hoarse and constricted. Tears specked the edges of his eyes. He frantically thought back, to his childhood.</p>

<p><em>What have I given??</em></p>

<p>As he stood in a daze, following the path the other initiates had taken out of the side of the Valley, he tried desperately to channel his thoughts, step through his memories methodically. Until he reached mother. Where was his mother? A small part within him whispered that she was dead. He knew this. But then who…</p>

<p>His father. He seized upon the words, cradling them to him like a precious gift. Tears now fell freely. His father. Khalid had given him up. He pushed, willing his mind to remember the man. But only inky blankness remained. He blinked again. His memories of his father were gone but… he couldn't remember why.</p>

<p>That night, he escaped the temple.</p>

<h1 id="chapter-1">Chapter 1</h1>

<p>“So, you survived the hazing ritual then,” Saira laughed, sipping her chai. “I'm surprised they let you all have the day off, though.”</p>

<p>Khalid wasn't smiling.</p>

<p>“Habibty… they're doing really bad things in there.”</p>

<p>“Well, yeah, it's the government. They're doing bad things definitionally. That's why we're robbing them.”</p>

<p>“No, it's,” he struggled for words. “Something happened to me last night. Something bad. My memories of it are hazy. But look, the plan is off, okay?”</p>

<p>Saira's jaw nearly hit the floor.</p>

<p>“You've got to be kidding me,” she said. “This is a joke. Haha very funny.”</p>

<p>“I'm serious.”</p>

<p>“No, <em>I'm</em> serious! We've spent more than four years of our lives toiling over this plan. You've studied more inane bullshit than any person ought to know in their life, and I've worked my ass off at the bar trying to fund this whole thing. Which I have. I might add.”</p>

<p>“It doesn't matter—” he began, before being cut off again.</p>

<p>“It <em>does</em> matter. Because we are in debt to some very bad, very angry people. Because nothing we could possibly steal in a hundred years outside the Cognoza's library would be worth one relic script from inside. Because the high priests have sucked the auroras dry, and blueprints for cogs have gone nonexistent, and a single blueprint will give us the ability to live some semblance of an actual life. And I don't want to die. Not here, not now, and definitely not in the slums of Aeurtuhm.”</p>

<p>Khalid shook his head sadly.</p>

<p>“Saira, they didn't give us the day off. I left. They're probably searching for me now. They'll kill me if they find me, same as the Dhakeen would.”</p>

<p>Now, slowly, his words began to sink in, and her face paled.</p>

<p>“Go back!” She scrambled to her feet. “Tell them you got cold feet but changed your mind! Gods sake Khalid don't fuck this up!!”</p>

<p>“You don't understand,” he said quietly. “The high priests have a secret. To how they stay in power, quell the rebellions, keep enemies from landing on our shores. They told us what it was…”</p>

<p>She glared at him expectantly.</p>

<p>“And?”</p>

<p>And… he grasped at it, but it was like sand in his fingers.</p>

<p>“And I can't remember. It was last night, Saira, so why can't I remember?”</p>

<p>She sat back down slowly, grabbing her tea and stirring it, peering at him with new eyes.</p>

<p>“Gods, Khalid… I don't know. Drugs?”</p>

<p>He shrugged miserably. “All I know is that whatever it was, while I could still remember, I thought it was bad enough that I chose to give up on our plan and run.”</p>

<p>Saira grimaced. “Could you have… you know. Burned them? The memories?”</p>

<p>“Obviously not,” he snapped. “Why would I burn the one set of memories that would allow me to explain to you what the fuck I went through? Besides. I didn't need to manifest anything to escape the temple. I… I don't think people normally leave once they're initiated.”</p>

<p>He felt a flash, through his mind. A golden mask.</p>

<p>“Are you ok??” Saira was shaking him. “Your eyes went goddamned white for a second. I thought a Djinn had taken you.”</p>

<p>He grunted. “Maybe that would be preferable. I think I'm… connected to one of the high priests. I can feel him.” He shuddered.</p>

<p>“Which one?”</p>

<p>“How the fuck should I know? They all wear those fucking masks,” he said dourly.</p>

<p>“Right. I just thought, you know, maybe in your head…”</p>

<p>He groaned and leaned back on the thick tent wall of their hovel.</p>

<p>“Look,” Saira reasoned, slowly. “You said they do bad shit, like really bad. Presumably to all the initiates. Some of them must run away right? You can't be the only person in a class of 200 to know something was fucked. I bet they're used to it. You're an asset they've already spent a lot of time training. Just go back. See if they'll let you in. If it seems like they're going to fuck you over we'll cut and run. I promise.”</p>

<p>Khalid tried to consider it, but the rapidly forming headache was quickly overwhelming his senses.</p>

<p>“It was only fifty, by the end,” he muttered, before slipping into unconsciousness.</p>

<p>\switchchar{*</p>

<p><em>Well, this is fucked,</em> Saira thought. <em>Guess I'll smoke a hookah about it.</em></p>

<p>She threw a blanket over Khalid, stopping to sneak a kiss to his forehead, and surveyed the tent. He looked convincingly like a heap of fabrics once she ruffled the blanket over him a bit.</p>

<p>Ducking out of the tent, she made her way down the alley and out into one of the narrow streets of Aeurtuhm's smelliest district. She felt nervous about leaving Khalid, but her mind was reeling and she needed to clear her head. Not to mention that if a priest of the Cognozi made an appearance in the slums, the ruckus would draw her attention without a doubt.</p>

<p>Hookah bars absolutely littered the district, tucked into every stone nook and sometimes even just out on the streets, the baking sun held back by the thinnest of colored fabric shades. But Saira knew the key to smoking in peace without gagging was to abandon ground level.</p>

<p>She peeled off into a nondescript alley that quickly turned into a stone staircase, wedged between two adjacent buildings. A few minutes later, huffing a not-insignificant amount and cringing at the sweat soaking the inside of her kamiz, she arrived at her destination.</p>

<p>Though the rooftop was a regrettable forty feet closer to the relentless sun, its awnings were of sturdier fabrics, and a light breeze drifting across the city's rooftops gave a passable effort at keeping her cool.</p>

<p>She immediately plunked down on one of the pillows arrayed in the space, as a servant brought a hookah over to her and placed it down.</p>

<p>Across the rooftops, she could see the city's obelisks cutting through the skyline, standing watch over their surroundings. She often felt the city was one giant trap for a god-bird that might fall from the sky and impale itself upon Aeurtuhm's many spikes.</p>

<p>The Yergheis district was in the southwest corner of the city, downhill from the majority of it. And downwind. Rooftops poked ever higher as she gazed north, eventually dwarfed by the inner walls which, paired with the slope, blocked view of the nicer districts. Yergheis wasn't quite a tent city; there were buildings here, in fact, the stone, flat-topped structures were older and more densely packed than the majority of the city. But the newer sections of the city had blocked off old, natural drainages, and now, the once or twice a year it rained, Yergheis flooded with a vengeance.</p>

<p>During the floods, the half transient, half local population of the district would clamber up to the rooftops. In between the floods, well, no one was willing to buy a home that would be flooded yearly. Some lived in upper stories of abandoned buildings, but most lived in tents lashed up between the windows lining the many alleys and streets. Saira's was lashed down to the ground — easier to get in and out of, but also easier to rob. Above her tent, more were held taught between the buildings, floating on air. Every alley had at least three levels of hanging tents, swaying gently one atop the other like a tower gone drunk.</p>

<p>It was a great place to lay low. <em>And honestly not that bad,</em> Saira mused. The buildings often left the alleyways somewhat shaded, the tents could be taken down and moved to another alley at moments notice. If it weren't for the smell…</p>

<p>Puffing pensively, Saira considered their situation. A tiny voice in the back of her head pointed out that now would be the time to cut and run, to not get wrapped up in whatever clearly-dangerous nonsense Khalid was now in. She could disappear into the city in moments and Khalid would never find her again. But then, her creditors were another story.</p>

<p>She swatted the thoughts away as she did the flies that were brave enough to assault her face. Khalid could be frustrating, but he was the closest thing she had to a friend, a companion, a sibling — in Aeurtuhm, anyone you could count on deserved a place of respect in your heart. Besides, they'd planned the job together, and the prize was as much her right as his.</p>

<p><em>As are the consequences</em>, she reminded herself.</p>

<p>The obvious answer was to get Khalid back in. She believed him that the priesthood was fucked up. Neuromantic power was fucked up as it was. She had no doubt the priests had worked out vile and ethically reprehensible ways of extending their power.</p>

<p>But he didn't need to spend his life there. He just needed to stay in long enough to get access to the library and obtain a reasonable excuse to visit it. She didn't know what the timeline for fucked up shit was for incoming priests, but she had to think it wasn't <em>all</em> in the first week, right?</p>

<p>Nevertheless, the cogs in her mind were already churning, considering the possibility they'd have to bail town. Gears ground against bad solutions. There weren't many ways out of Aeurtuhm, and none of the existing ways were cheap.</p>

<p>Particularly not cheap and quiet. The Dhakeen had eyes around the city and knew well the sordid details of every caravan arriving and departing Aeurtuhm's walls. Smuggling was, after all, their core business.</p>

<p>Leasing a camel was likewise off the table; it would be harder to track, but more expensive, and Saira didn't fancy their chances alone in the desert.</p>

<p>That pretty much left the river as the only feasible option. Riverboats passed through frequently enough that the Dhakeen couldn't possibly monitor all of them. They also couldn't afford passage, but they could make do stowing away, slipping overboard when things got hot and trying to climb aboard the next passing vessel. She tried not to think about the wildlife of the river as this plan formulated.</p>

<p>She was three towns and two transfers downriver of Aeurtuhm when she felt a presence plop down onto the cushions opposite her hookah.</p>

<p>“Ahh, Saira, looking beautiful as a starflower as always,” the deep voice rumbled across the space between them.</p>

<p>“And just as poisonous,” she replied dutifully, rolling her eyes but handing over the hookah nonetheless. As the man across from her puffed, she adjusted her headscarf slightly, feeling the prickle at the back of her neck.</p>

<p>“No need to be nervous <em>sokar</em>,” he purred. “Just a friendly visit.”</p>

<p>Shockingly, the supplication did not give Saira much confidence. The man across from her was, to her knowledge, roughly her age. But with a flick of his wrist, he might fling her from the rooftop without much effort. His muscles flexed under dark skin, belaying the hidden power she knew they carried.</p>

<p>“And what brings me the honor of a friendly visit?” She held out a hand, trying to appear more confident than she was, and he passed the hose handle back to her casually, letting the rough calluses of his fingers brush a moment longer than necessary against her palm.</p>

<p>Saira took a deep inhale.</p>

<p>“A friend cannot check in on a friend?” he asked, ever the gentlemen, before his brows furrowed. “We, of course, are friends. We have no ill-will in our hearts for each other. I wish it to stay this way, of course, but our mutual friends grow restless, and perhaps would be set at ease by some sense of your progress.”</p>

<p>Regarding him coolly, Saira said “Everything proceeds to plan, Nasr. I did not speak lightly when I offered a script, and I am… within a month of supplying it.”</p>

<p>Nasr stretched out on the cushions, not unlike a large cat. “Wonderful. This is good news to hear. Although, I must admit, I have heard whispers among our friends that your promises are nothing more than wavering air above the desert. Have you anything to convince them your posturing is not such a mirage?”</p>

<p>Saira chose her words carefully. She had, with great difficulty, managed to keep Khalid's name out of her negotiations with the Dhakeen. Not just to protect him, either; as soon as her operative on the inside was compromised, the Dhakeen were likely to simply cut her from the equation and pressure him directly.</p>

<p>“As you know,” she said, “The Cognozi have just ascended a new class of initiates into their ranks.”</p>

<p>Nasr raised an eyebrow. “Ah, and presumably one of these little priests is a friend of yours.”</p>

<p>Saira now took the opportunity to stretch, holding the mouthpiece, elongating her form and allowing the curves of her garb to accentuate her form. “Friend, perhaps. Someone who has agreed to do me a favor.”</p>

<p>She watched carefully as Nasr made the connections she hoped he would. It wouldn't help either her or Khalid for the Dhakeen to know they were mutually leveragable against each other. Better for him to think she'd enthralled a hapless initiate.</p>

<p>“Forgive my impertinence,” Nasr drawled, reaching out and swiping the mouthpiece, “but <em>mozza</em> or no, I struggle to believe a new priest would give it all up for a woman.”</p>

<p>Saira rolled her eyes. <em>Have you met a young man recently?</em></p>

<p>“Let's just say that my <em>friend</em> believes that many good things will happen for him and his family if he helps me, at minimal risk. And by many good things, I mean <em>not</em> many bad things.”</p>

<p>A booming laugh filled the rooftop as Nasr bellowed, smoke venting from his mouth and nose. “Ah Saira, I do think you are my favorite friend. I dare not ask who you have enforcing such an agreement, but with wits like this about you, I wager you could easily be a member of our family.”</p>

<p>Saira shrugged. “It is too bad you do not accept new family with any debt.”</p>

<p>Nasr's face briefly darkened, his eyes flashing in the shade between them.</p>

<p>“Indeed,” he said. “Some things come first.”</p>

<p>Thankfully, Nasr then stood, placing the mouthpiece gently onto the ashtray. Saira felt the gooseflesh on her neck. Nasr cracked a few knuckles, then winked at her.</p>

<p>“One month,” he said. “I shall pass this along. But I will tell you this for free. I imagine they will give you two weeks. So you best flash whatever that boy in the priesthood needs to get a move on.”</p>

<p>With that, he absconded the rooftop, moving far more lithely and quietly than a man of his size should.</p>

<p>Saira took a shuddering breath. <em>Well, Khalid had better go back,</em> she thought.</p>

<h1 id="chapter-2">Chapter 2</h1>

<p>Khalid knelt before the priest Cognozi in an antechamber of the high temple, head bowed. Makrim had been the teacher for some of his classes, and evidently was charged with dealing with runaways.</p>

<p>“I'm sorry Maram Makrim,” he said. “After the ceremony, I was disoriented and scared. I just wanted to see my family.”</p>

<p>The lie almost caught in his throat, but then he was thought of Saira, figured that was close enough, and powered onward.</p>

<p>“I should have come to you, I know this. I just, I could not even remember much of the ceremony…”</p>

<p>This was the dangerous part of the lie. Khalid hoped such loss of memory was a common after effect — he could easily imagine it happening to him if he hadn't been focusing so strongly on remembering.</p>

<p>He felt a hand touch his down-turned chin and raise it up. The man’s dark brown skin was wrinkled around his eyes, and he smiled. The paternal nature of it sent a shiver through Khalid, and he tried not to recoil. Or vomit.</p>

<p>“It is alright, young one,” he said kindly.</p>

<p><em>He never learned my name,</em> Khalid thought.</p>

<p>“The day after the ceremony can indeed be frightening and disorienting. You are not alone in this. But you fulfilled the initiation admirably, and you deserve to take your place in the ranks of the Cognozi.”</p>

<p>Khalid let out a tremoring breath he didn't know he was holding.</p>

<p>“Thank you elder,” he said, bowing his head again. “My head is clear now, as is my purpose.” He hoped that was the sort of drivel that Makrim wanted to hear.</p>

<p>Makrim stood, sweeping his arms. “I am gladdened to hear it, child. And while I would raise you into our ranks without haste, alas the priesthood has its rules. So you shall spend one month in prayer and fast with the acolytes, to focus your intents, and meet once per week with the scepteram to demonstrate your academic retention.”</p>

<p>Khalid felt his heart sink. He <em>couldn't</em> spend a month here. Especially not with the acolytes. He may have been a fake initiate, but he'd earned his way in and survived the classes — the acolytes were dumb, manipulatable fervents, beggars and idolants from the streets clamoring for a dribbling of power. He had no desire to spend time around them, nor to fast, nor to rehash his lessons with the scepteram.</p>

<p>Grinding his teeth in frustration, he said
“Yes Maram, this seems a wise and appropriate practice to purify me for the ascent.”</p>

<p>“Yalla, then, and to the temple courtyard with you,” Makrim said, waving a hand in dismissal.</p>

<p><em>Pompous dog,</em> Khalid thought as he exited.</p>

<p>The courtyard of the temple was open to the air — and the heat — and was the only portion of the temple accessible to the public. Acolytes milled about, having been granted low level jobs to aid the priests within: taking testimony and offerings, cleaning the pillars, other equally inane things, as far as Khalid saw it,</p>

<p>In the courtyard’s center rose the obelisk which marked it as Aeurtuhm’s high temple. It towered over the courtyard, and he knew, the surrounding city. Though tucked within the grand inner walls, he knew it was visible from almost anywhere in Aeurtuhm.</p>

<p>Its five sides of smoothed, polished stone held carved depictions of the five neuromantic arts. He circled slowly taking in the images of great heroes burning their memories of training to strengthen their speed and agility in combat, of sorcerers channeling their grief and trauma, or, on the next panel over, their joy, to wreck their will upon the world. One panel showed no figures, only the impression of a relic script — a detailed blueprint of an ancient weapon that a cognitoneuromancer, or cog, could manifest into reality, albeit temporarily.</p>

<p><em>I wonder how many try to use this script,</em> he thought, knowing full well the inscription was riddled with deliberate errors that would prevent it from manifesting.</p>

<p>The final panel simply held columns and columns of etched numbers. Khalid knew it to be a fundamental, infinite number, the circumference of a circle divided by its diameter. He scoffed. Arithroneuromancy was by far the weakest of the arts.</p>

<p>Khalid felt a tingle in his fingertips, an itch, to dip into his mind and bring something forth. Cogs were always jumpy to manifest; holding complex designs and plans was more challenging than simply incorporating memories of monotonous combat training. After a while, the memories faded, and weakened the manifestation.</p>

<p>But Khalid held himself. He'd had enough of his mind being fucked with for one day.</p>

<p>Instead, he trudged over to the entrance to the courtyard, where Aasim, the acolyte in charge stood pouring water from a clay jug into the outstretched hands of supplicants.</p>

<p>“Aasim,” he said, injecting a false cheer into his voice, and a hint of supplication that would, he hoped, immediately go to Aasim's head. “Might I lend you a hand here in the courtyard?”</p>

<p>Aasim turned to him and grinned.</p>

<p>“Yes, of course,” he said, waving an arm, “I welcome all initiates who wish to further commit themselves to our temple here amongst the common folk.” His grin vanished. “Of course, I know that <em>you</em> are only here upon word of Maram Makrim, for what punishment I cannot imagine. So if you think you will weasel past me for quick passage back into the Valley, you are sorely mistaken.”</p>

<p>Khalid resisted the urge to groan, Saira's words ringing in his skull. <em>Two weeks,</em> he thought. <em>The net is closing.</em></p>

<p>And so when Aasim handed him a bucket full of wet rags and imperiously commanded him to scrub the pillars, he bowed without complaint and set toward his task.</p>

<p>\switchchar{*</p>

<p>Saira sat in a small coffee stall tucked into a side street of the Faraami district that emptied onto Aeurtuhm's grand square. She shifted her weight about constantly, trying to keep the shadow of the thin, fluttering fabric of the awning above her over her face. She was mostly unsuccessful.</p>

<p>Out on the square, hundreds of workers moved like ants in overlapping diagonal paths, taking advantage of the open space to traverse from the western marketplaces to the eastern governmental districts without cramming through claustrophobic alleys. On the other side of the square, a massive, temple-like structure rose above the city around it, its imposing facade casting a blessed shadow at its base within which many overheated stray cats and dogs lounged.</p>

<p>Saira knew the building well — at least, from the outside. She had cased the Library of Aeurtuhm a dozen times, probing and prodding for its weaknesses, for any late-night opportunities it provided to slip inside. She had found none, of course. That was why Khalid was suffering his way into priesthood.</p>

<p><em>There must be something,</em> she thought bitterly. With things going as they were with Khalid, Saira was growing increasingly concerned she may have to breach the library herself. At minimum, to carve an exit route for Khalid once he made it inside.</p>

<p>The front of the library was a sheer wall of stone, hundreds of feet high, inset with two massive wooden doors. Saira had no idea what mechanism could open such things, but it would not be her. Two bored guards stood at either side of the doors, occasionally tossing scraps to the arrayed animals. They were right to be bored; in all her time gazing longingly at the library, she had never once seen those doors open.</p>

<p>A loop around the library would reveal three high walls connecting to the facade, not as tall, but still frustratingly unscaleable. The press of Aeurtuhm cared not for the sacred library; buildings butted up all the way to the walls, sometimes leaving no alley space at all, the corners of stone buildings scraping against the walls. This did not help Saira, however, as the roofs of these buildings were still dozens of feet below the wall's height.</p>

<p>And, of course, there were guards who walked the ramparts, eyes keen for any ropes or black-clad girls looking to rob them of their treasures.</p>

<p>No public plans for what lay inside those walls were available, but Saira had bribed enough of the right type of government worker to learn the basic layout. A courtyard lay behind the facade, lined on each side with small administrative buildings, and at the rear, the library itself. She'd heard it was not much to look at; evidently, the majority of it was underground, the actual above ground portion resembling a dull, single steppe. This building reportedly also had a single point of entry — a door opening onto the courtyard. No windows (a thought which made Saira shudder), and walls several thick feet in solid stone.</p>

<p>She had heard rumors, unsubstantiated, that some government buildings on the eastern rise had underground tunnels which led directly to the library. <em>Lovely, if they weren't likely manned by guards armed to the teeth at both ends, and the middles for good measure.</em></p>

<p>Saira sighed. <em>This is why our plan was so wise. Why break into an impregnable fortress when you can simply waltz in legally?</em> Four years was hardly that long, for the value of what they might find inside.</p>
